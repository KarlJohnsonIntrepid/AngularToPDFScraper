    <Content>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theres only one week left at work, we move out the flat next weekend. What better way to celebebrate than by holding a leaving party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While everyone was either relaxing or travelling to Manchester the party preparations were taking place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manchester-leaving-(80).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Getting ready, Leanne looks beautiful as always&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manchester-leaving-(45).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The birthday boy Adam Brown was first to arrive, he can just about manage a fake smile to hide his embarassment&amp;nbsp;towards his birthday shrine!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manchester-leaving-(43).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leanne tempts the boys with prosecco and fruit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manchester-leaving-(46).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hally makes his own unique version&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manchester-leaving-(47).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The girls arrive on the scene&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manchester-leaving-(48).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Many thanks to Kat for coming, &amp;nbsp;she&amp;nbsp;has to go back to London in only a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manchester-leaving-(65).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cocktails are served&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manchester-leaving-(49).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strange happenings in the kitchen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manchester-leaving-(50).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A neighbour returns, Dan turns up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manchester-leaving-(53).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Becki and Luke arrive, travelling all the way from Newcastle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manchester-leaving-(79).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group Photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manchester-leaving-(59).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And another group photo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/manchester-group.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I huff and l puff&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manchester-leaving-(69).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And off we went in to Manchester....... Sorry theres no photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manchester-dancing.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/manchester-group2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime later once the sun had risen, one white shirt is ruined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manchester-leaving-(71).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time the next day around 9.30 its off to WeatherSpoons for breakfast &amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manchester-leaving-(76).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manchester-leaving-(77).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six years ago I turned up to this house for a job interview, I wondered if people actually worked here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/leaving-compass-(18).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out they do..... &amp;nbsp;Six years of developing software, in a house, in Helsby. Its now time to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/leaving-compass-(1).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank everyone who turned up for leaving drinks&amp;nbsp;awell as those who couldnt make it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/leaving-compass-(6).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now its time to say goodbye, &amp;nbsp;thank you all, &amp;nbsp;its&amp;nbsp;a pleasure to say I worked for Compass Computer Consultants.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Home sweet home - Northumberland and Newcastle</Title>
    <TitleURL>uk/travel/home-sweet-home-northumberland-and-newcastle</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-04-25T13:12:06.237+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;We have been back in the North East for a week now. Feeling relaxed and stress free after quitting our jobs and leaving Manchester we decided to make the most of the uncharacteristically good April weather by visiting the Northumbrian coastal castle of Bamburgh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/bambourgh-castle.jpg" alt="bambourgh catle"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was nice to reminisce over our memories of school trips to Lindisfarne and Sea Houses. As was the case with most children of the North East we were wrapped up in several layers of clothes to fight off the icy North Sea wind, shipped on a boat to be slightly impressed by the Puffins and Seals which habitat the Farne islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/lindisfarne.jpg" alt="lindisfarne"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But today the weather was good and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see why Northumberland is the UK&amp;rsquo;s best kept secret, with more castles than any other county, sparsely populated with gorgeous beaches and Northumberland national park to boot there&amp;rsquo;s plenty to do here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/bambourgh-beach-1.jpg" alt="bambourgh beach"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following our trip to Bamburgh we spent some time on the more familiar Blyth beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/blyth-beach.jpg" alt="blyth beach"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Recently renovated this has now become a hub for people coming to visit the town. We ate the obligatory fish and chips and took in the familiar sights of the sea, sand dunes and beach huts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/blyth-beach-houses.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No trip to the north east would be complete without a visit to Newcastle. Our home city has always been the source of much pride as we have travelled and worked in various places. It&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful city full of history and tradition. Some would say it also has its own language as not many people outside of area can understand a Geordie, especially after a few pints!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tyne-bridge-(1).jpg" alt="tyne-bridge"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a view of the Tyne Bridge above us we enjoyed a traditional drink of &lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/uk/drink-reviews/newcastle-brown-ale/"&gt;Brown Ale&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/brown-ale-tyne-bridge.jpg" alt="brown ale tyne bridge"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is days like these where you really see the beauty of the area and we can really appreciate the fact that there is no better place in the world than our home town.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Newcastle Brown Ale</Title>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/brown-ale-review-(2).jpg" alt="brown ale bottle"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years ale has become a fashionable drink. Its seems like almost everyone in England has a micro-brewery producing hoppy and fruity ales which can be enjoyed by the young and trendy crowds which would have usually cowered closely to their wine bars at the mention of an IPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brown ale is not one of those drinks. Brown ale is a traditional beer, and one that demands respect as the flagship drink of the working man of the North East. Sometimes it is referred to as Dog, Newkie Brown, or &amp;lsquo;Broon Ale&amp;rsquo; in the local Geordie dialect. Its name says it all as it is a dark ale of subtle taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label has always proudly introduced the Tyne Bridge to many drinkers around the world. However, it is the export of the beer to the US which has caused the recipe to change in recent months. With fears that the chemical which made the beer its characteristic colour may contain carcinogenic food colouring the American food association has forced the change. All we can say is that it never did our Grandad&amp;rsquo;s any harm, and they drank gallons of the stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we take a sip the smell conjures images of working men&amp;rsquo;s social clubs and the feeling of a well-deserved beer after a hard days graft. It tastes crisp, refreshing and delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the rise of the trendy beers, Brown Ale still remains the number one bestselling bottled beer in Britain and is regularly voted in the top 10 in America. Sitting under the Tyne Bridge it&amp;rsquo;s easy for us to bask in the pride of the North East and its world famous drink.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>The Journey Begins in Vancouver</Title>
    <TitleURL>canada/travel/the-journey-begins-in-vancouver</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-05-06T16:00:31.53+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;h3&gt;Day 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As sure as day turns into night, day turned into day. The plane departed at 12.50pm and touched down at 2.05pm, the french speaking air hostess assumed this meant '2 Past 5', indeed this sounds more plausable consdering the journey took 9 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/vancouver_skyline.jpg" alt="Vancouver Skyline"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone arriving at a foreign airport with a backpack on will know that seeing set taxi fares is a good way to start your journey. There is no fear of being ripped off. In fact the fees are all pre-set based on zones and tightly regulated. An easy start to the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/vancouver-sunrise-(1).jpg" alt="Vancouver sunrise"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had been in Canada for less than a hour and we already felt we needed to learn more about trees. Its not just the maple leaf plastered on flags and advertisments that grabs your attention. Its hard not to notice them glowing shades of red and green. Enormous pines that reach for the sun , maples in blossom line the straight well designed streets which are &amp;nbsp;guarded by the mountains that dominate the horzion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/vancouver-trees-color.jpg" alt="vancouver trees in colour"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hotel (Patrica budget Inn) is cheap and its old, although you could say vintage. In fact the hotel was built in 1913 and in this part of the world it could be classed as 'historic'.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downstairs in the bar a jazz band was playing, we ordered the home brewed beer, ate burgers and then went on to to go to sleep at 5pm local time. When we woke at 2am it then felt like the night that never ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After waking in the middle of the night we set off for a early morning walk around the harbour. Its a perfect time to see the city, the light of the morning sun lit up the mountains and the sea as the ideal backdrop to the skyline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/vancouver-docks.jpg" alt="vancouver docks"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many friendy Canadians wanted to tell us, today is the annual Vancouver marathon. So many of the walking routes had been closed off. We still managed to get ourselves inside the officially "closed" Stanley Park. Despite the runners circling the outer seawall the interior of the park was virtually empty.It was easy to get lost in the dense forests and forget you are in the middle of a city. We wondered around the various highlights and even cought sight of a racoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/stantley-park-totem-(1).jpg" alt="totem stanley park"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we spent the day wondering through the city with the sun shining down it was easy to see why it is often voted in the top ten places in the world to live. It really does seem to have it all. Mounatins, sea, parks, beaches, shops, bars, skiing and hiking are all on your doorstep. The only exception to this is a small area in the Downtown district where the friendly smiles suddenly stop. This area is home to Vancouvers drug addicts, dealers, prostitutes, and mentaly insane....and also our hotel! Crack whores aside, in reality, it is no more thretening than Blyth on a Saturday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/vancouver-steam-clock.jpg" alt="gas town steam clock"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the afternoon we headed to the trendy Gastown area which boasts an infamouse steam clock (which is actually powered by electricity!) and several hip and trendly bars offering their own speciality beers. We spent our afternoon sampling the craft beers in a bar called Alibi.&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/canada/drink-reviews/canadian-craft-beer/"&gt;(Canadian Craft Beer Review) &lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;Our first full day of travelling complete, we headed home at a ridiculously early hour, exhausted and slightly tipsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We started today on Granville Island and its renowned market. If you look past the typical tourist tat on offer there are some great craft shops and local art. Unfortunatly we had to resist the urge to buy anything. Instead we headed to the food stalls. Stitting in the sun with a coffee we were able to watch the world go buy while listening to the chilled out music from the steet performers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/vancouver-granville-market-(2).jpg" alt="granville market"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We picked up some food from the market for a picnic and headed to the nearby Vanier park. The strawberries and beef jerkey were a particular delight. &lt;br /&gt;After lunch we couldnt face another long walk so we took the small ferry back via the length of False Creek and dropped it us off at science world only a short walk back to the hotel for our tired legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/vancouver-boatride.jpg" alt="false creek ferry"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An exceptionally large proportion of Vancouver is chinese and the chinese cooking here is often regarded as the best outside of Asia, a good sign is when you cant understand anything on the menu! Our best meal so far and a wonderfull and cheap way to end the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day 4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tired from all the walking today was about relaxing, Tuesday just happens to be the day of half price tickets in Vancouver. Half price cinema tickets can be found at the International Village. This occupied the afternoon and in the evening the Vancouver Art Gallery is free (but there is a recommended&amp;nbsp;dontation of $10 which they will ask you for, but there is no obligation to pay).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/vancouver-harbour.jpg" alt="vancouver harbour cloudy"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vancouver has been a successfull trip, now its time to go to the USA, first stop Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;h3&gt;Day 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As sure as day turns into night, day turned into day. The plane departed at 12.50pm and touched down at 2.05pm, the french speaking air hostess assumed this meant '2 Past 5', indeed this sounds more plausable consdering the journey took 9 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/vancouver-craft-beer-review-(7).jpg" alt="peche mortal"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vancouver is a city which was founded on alcohol. As all the guidebooks will tell you it was the Englishman, Jack Deighton or "Gassy" to his mates, who arrived in area in 1867 with his wife, dog and a barrel of whiskey and set up the first tavern in the area now fondly refered to as Gastown. So with this story in mind we headed to the now trendy area to find our Canadian beverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although whiskey was the drink which set up the city it was mainly inported from Ireland and Scotland. What is hard to miss is the rise of the micro breweries. Almost every bar we passed boasted its own craft beer selection so we decided to sample a few of these in one of Vancouvers best craft-beer taverns, Alibi Room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first drink Karl sampled was the Tofino's "Hoppy Cretin" IPA (7%). Picking a drink purely based on its name, I went for Breakside "Wanderlust" IPA (6.7%). Both of these drinks tasted so much of Hops you could actually feel it fizz on your tounge, a bit like eating popping candy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/vancouver-craft-beer-review-(3).jpg" alt="craft beer"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For our secound choice Karl went for Dieu de Ciel - "Peche Mortel" NITRO POUR Imperial Coffee Stout (9.5%) while I went for a slightly more reserved house cider. Karl sensibly went for a small glass of the stout which looked alot like a cold coffee, the taste was bitter and like coffee beans had been ground in your mouth. You cant quite tell if you love it or hate it but it certainly left you wanting more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/vancouver-craft-beer-review-(4).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not satisfied that he had sampled enough of the ales Karl went for a 3rd drink. Howe Sand "King Hefe" Imperial Hefwiezen (8%) because aparantly it would be rude not to try the wheat beer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the beers and bars in Vancouver lived up to our high expectations. However at $7-8 a drink we clearly wont be going on any crazy nights out while we are here.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Journey to Seattle and Portland - In search of Fraser Crane and a giant space needle</Title>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short 15 minute hike with the bags through downtown Vancouver and we are at the bus station. Once the tickets were collected from the Amatrak Ticket office we completed the custom declaration forms and the I-94 visa waiver form and waited for the bus to take us across the USA border to Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/vancouver-to-portland-bus-(1).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trees, more trees than I have ever seen, alpine forest, lakes and mountains. Thats about all I will see of washington state, and all out of the bus window. Its finally sunk in what we are doing, Vancouver felt like a city break. Overland by bus, this feels like traveling. And theres another 10000 miles after this to go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Seattle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/seattle-waterside.jpg" alt="Seattle waterside"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraser Crane could not be found, surely he will be in one of the coffee shops. Hmmm not even on the radio, thats strange. Perhaps some fish and chips will lighten the mood from the harbour. "One alaskan atlantic cod and chips please", 5 minutes later were eating fish fingers and fries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/seattle-fish-and-chips.jpg" alt="Seattle Fish and chips"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick tour through Pioneer Square, Pike Place Market and Seattle Centre (where we found the giant space needle) and that was Seattle done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Seattle To Portland &amp;ndash; A precarious drive down the I5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is the day we picked up our hire car, (Alamo) in the middle of dowtown Seattle, with no idea how to navigate the roads or how to drive an automatic. We rationalised that Karl was probably the best person to get us out the city safely. This was questionable when he kept mistaking the brake for the clutch.There were genuine moments when we feared for our lives! How someone didnt go into the back of us is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/hire-car-washington-service.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully once we hit the Interstate Karl was crusing along at a safe 60mph and we were able to relax slightly and enjoy the sun and scenery. Our main aim now that we had a car was to purchase some camping gear, so the sight we were hoping to spot was a large Walmart, which we found just before reaching Portland. We managed to get a tent, airbed, stove,2 chairs, pans, plates, coolbox and various other items for $200. Bargin! There is nothing that Walmart doesnt sell!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hotel in Portland is the best we have stayed in so far (University Place Hotel). After eating so much processed meats and snacks we decided to spend the afternoon in the gym in the hope that a 2 hour workout will cancel out the burgers, beers and pizza's we have been gorging on.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Redwood National Park - Camping with bears among the biggest trees on earth</Title>
    <TitleURL>usa/travel/redwood-national-park-camping-with-bears-among-the-biggest-trees-on-earth</TitleURL>

    <Content>&lt;h3&gt;Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park&amp;nbsp;- Day 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending 7 nights in cities we were both looking forward to getting out into the Great American wilderness. As we crossed states into California and saw the forests tower ahead we knew we were out the comfort of city life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/p1000591.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We arrived at Jeddadiah State Camp Site, one of the few that is open this early in the season. Each spot had its own picnic table, fire pit and bear box! We were informed by the camp site host's that both bears and mountain lions had been spotted as there haven't been enough tourists to scare them off yet. Great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/p1000533.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our camping spot is in the middle of the dense Redwood forest. The trees are breathtaking. This is nature at its most spectacular. Natures giants tower over you an make you feel so small. As we set up our camp we really felt as though we had found our own secluded spot for admiring these magnificent trees... that is until Mr RV turns up with a HUGE camper van the size of our entire flat back in Manchester. We have to give the guy some credit as it took skill to reverse the beast into the small camping spot OPPOSITE our camp. The relaxing sounds of the wind in the leaves and birds in the sky was interrupted with the continuous drone of a generator. Thankfully this stopped at 7pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/p1000532.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is something satisfying about building your own tent, cooking outdoors and building a fire. It must be our primal instincts. I think we both prefer this to the city. But it is cold. As the sky darkens and the fire starts to die out we climb into our tent and I suddenly wish i had a thicker sleeping bag. I dream of the -10 degrees down sleeping bag I had on the Everest trek as I cling to the flimsy piece of cloth someone sold us as a sleeping bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/p1000567.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wake up in the night bursting for the toilet. Those cans of beer seemed like a great idea at the time. There is no way I'm facing the bears and mountain lions alone. I wake Karl up. He tried to convince me its was nearly morning and will be getting light soon. I look at the clock and its 11.30pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/p1000602.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toilet block is only 200m away but with only a head torch to guide you through the trees it may as well be miles away. I keep imagining eyes staring back at me. As i turn around to fasten the tent I look around and cant see Karl. All the memories of american horror films come flooding back. The Blair Witch Project. Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Killer Bears!! (that's not a film but just what went through my head), I screamed. Ran. Then tripped on a tree root and almost face planted the ground. Karl suddenly appears from behind the car asking what the hell I'm doing. I grab hold of him. Heart rate at 250 bpm. "I thought I was going to die!" I say. Un-fazed by my panic Karl leads the way to the toilet block. Needlessly to say, I didn't get much sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park&amp;nbsp;- Day 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waking up freezing cold I made one of the aims of the day to find another blanket to keep us warm. Once we were up we made breakfast on our stove and headed out to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/p1000600.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without having a great deal of knowledge of the area we headed to the local information point where the most helpful man in the world told us everything we would ever need to know about the redwoods. Leaving with our arms full of maps and leaflets we picked a nearby walk called 'Boy scout trail' which went through some of the widest trees in the area. What we thought would be a relatively easy 6 mile walk felt alot longer due to the winding paths. It was well worth the effort as each corner revealed another amazing view. These really are trees on steroids! You would not be fazed if you saw fairies or pixies jumping from the enormous mushrooms which line these trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/p1000610.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/p1000604.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/p1000597.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at camp, feeling like the the wild woman of the wood, I suggest that I start the fire tonight. Karl looks at me disappointedly "but that's the man's job" he says. He knows how much I love gender stereotyping and I immediately want to protest, but he does look upset, and he did have so much fun last night. Rather than make it myself I suggest we build it together and he can teach me. This works out well as apparently I don't actually have a clue how to start a fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We sit back triumphant at our joint effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man makes fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fire feels good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/p1000580.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cavemen in us is out in full force. The cool beer tastes sweeter by the warmth of the flames. If only all domestic tasks felt this good.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Portland - Weird is Good</Title>

    <DateCreated>2015-05-12T16:38:18.433+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Portland - Oregon, with its trendy bars and micro breweries defines the Pacific North West. With very few sky scrapers its not your typical american city and neither are its citizens. Populated by hipsters, mircobrewers, avid book readers, forward thinkers and people that just want to be different. Even the tramps here look cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/keep-prtland-weird.jpg" alt="portland weird"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We spent the morning walking along the Tom MacCall water front park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/portland-river.jpg" alt="portland waterfront"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then we checked out some of the trendy bars in the old town Leanne picked up the courage to try and oyster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/oyster-close-up.jpg" alt="oyster shooter"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its true that travel changes your persective on life, for some one who never eats anything out of the sea this is a brave move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/p1000471.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/p1000473.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/p1000474.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The face says it all....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After eating oysters we went for a walk around the rest of the city. Powells City of Books claims to be the biggest book store in the world. Its certainly the biggest book store we have ever been in. Located over several floors it takes up an enitre city block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As well as having more mircobrewies than any other city in the world Portland is famed for its street food. With street vendors gathered together in groups around the city your spoilt for choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/portland-street-stalls.jpg" alt="portland street stalls"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To end the day we chose a thai street vendor and we were certainly not dissapointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/p1000488.jpg" alt="thai food portland"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, other than pretending to be cool theres not much else to see as a tourist. I feel due to the pace of the trip we have missed alot of what Orgeon has to offer mainly Crater Lake and Mount Hood National Park. Perhaps after visiting 3 Pacific North West cities its just time to get out into the wild, next stop Redwood National Park, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/p1000494.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Avenue Of Giants</Title>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;150 Miles into the 300 mile drive from Jeddiah Smith Redwood Park to Sonoma lies the Avenue of Giants, described as "This world-famous scenic drive is an alternate 31 mile country road which parallels and intersects highway 101 with its 51,222 acres of maginficent redwood groves".This sounds a good place to break up the drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Founders Grove&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founders grove has a short half mile walk around some of the biggest trees in the park. The Founders Tree was dedicated to those who led the drive to establish the &amp;ldquo;Save-the-Redwoods League&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/founders-grove-sign.jpg" alt="founders grove sign"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parts of this place are like a tree grave yard, with many trees ending their long life on the forest floor. The roots inparticular are spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/fallen-redwood-roots.jpg" alt="fallen redwood roots"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dyerville Giant was recognized as the &amp;ldquo;Champion&amp;rdquo; Coast Redwood as certified by the American Forestry Association until it fell on March 24, 1991. Its final height has been estimated at 375 feet. That is 200 feet taller than Niagara Falls or comparable to a 30-story building. It is also 17 feet in diameter and 52 feet in circumference. It probably weighs over 1,000,000 pounds, more than a jumbo jet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/dyerville-giant-trunk.jpg" alt="dyerville giant trunk"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere at the end you can see Leanne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chandelier Drive Through Tree&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within Avenue of Giants you can actually drive though a tree, the hole was cut in the 1930s clearly before the Save the Redwoods League was established. For a small price of $5 you can take a photo of your car in a tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/chandelier-tree-car-close.jpg" alt="chandelier tree car"   /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage im pretty worried about damaging the hire car!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/chandelier-tree-straight.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the pitstop completed its time to get back in the car, in 3 or 4 hours we will be in Sonoma, the heart of Californian wine country.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Californian Champagne </Title>
    <TitleURL>usa/drink-reviews/californian-champagne</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-05-14T23:12:43.69+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;After spending hours driving through the Californian vineyards I was more than ready to sample their delights. Arriving in the Sonoma area late in the afternoon we decided to stop off at the local Korbel winery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sonoma-vineyard.jpg" alt="sonoma vineyard"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Korbel winery is different to the hundreds of others in the region as it specialises in champagne, or fizzy wine as the French would have you call it. As the Korbels are clear to announce, there is a document which states that a &amp;ldquo;Semi-generic&amp;rdquo; designation can be used to indicate wines not from the original Champagne region as long as the name of the originating region (in this case California) is added to the label. I'm no champagne connoisseur so I was pleasantly surprised by the crisp,cool, refreshing taste of the wines which we were able to sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/korbel-winery.jpg" alt="korbel winery"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of our tasting we were given 7 complimentary wines to sample. The recommendation from the staff was that we start with the driest and work our way to the sweetest. These ranged from 0.1% to 6% sugar. We were also told, by the friendly sommelier, that all champagne bottles take 6 half turns of the metal cage to open the corkscrew. Another useless fact to pull out next time we are drinking champagne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/krobel-wine-tasting-(3).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The appellation (where the grape comes from) is the Russian River Valley. In my blissed out state I can taste the California sun in each mouthful. Clearly I'm drunk. For only &amp;pound;10 a bottle we select 2 of our favourites to take with us. I select the Korbel Natural. At its lowest sugar content, this is one of the driest wines on offer and has been a favourite with many Presidents, being served exclusively at Presidential inaugurations since 1981. Karl chooses a sweeter more original red wine champagne. Both bottles are devoured as soon as we arrive at our cottage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/krobel-wine-tasting-(2).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;I go to bed drunk and happy as I know tomorrow will be spent sampling more wines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/korbel-rouge-and-glass.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This place is like Disney Land for winos!&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Californian Pinot Noir</Title>
    <TitleURL>usa/drink-reviews/californian-pinot-noir</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-05-15T00:26:21.077+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Sonoma County, Californias wine region. 400 plus wineries offer tasting and tours, you can visit vine-yards, barrel rooms and wine caves and get drunk while doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds good... except the wine. I just dont like it. But hey were here now, leanne is in her element and I am&amp;nbsp;open to try it once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we&amp;nbsp;are&amp;nbsp;in the Russian River Valley, famed for producing the best Pinot noir in the region. The winery of choice HKG (Hop Kiln Grown) Estate Wines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/hkg-wine-building.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The building is nice, the sun's shining and there is plenty of wine to be drunk. Im also the desginated driver. The wine tastings starts with a rose of Pinot Noir and a Chardonay. Im not impressed, Leanne clearly see's something I dont.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/walter-ranch-hop-kiln.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then its on to the Pinot Noir, each bottle is of the 2012 vintage. Imaginatively called HKG Pinot Noir followed by the field it was grown. The smaller the field the grape was grown in the more expensive the bottle, using that logic why not make all the fields smaller and sell the wine for more? I dont think I will ever understand the logic of wine, apparently the less of a bottle made the more its worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/hkg-wine-tasting.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After tasting all the Pinot Noirs my mind is made up. The first is described as having aromas of the forest floor and cherries. I cant imagine a forest floor tasting nice, sounds like an acurate description, perhaps more so if it was 'aromas of forest floor, freshly urinated on by a new born bear'.The final bottle at $60 is described as 'silky' and finishes with a 'french oak toast' profile. My description would be oily, with undertones of an oak aged toilet brush. Perhaps I should have used the spit bucket, but it would be a shame to waste it. While I struggle to keep the wine down Leanne on the other hand is loving every moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/drinking-wine-byllake-(3).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We go to one more winery and as the designated driver when we get back to the cottage I get to have a much deserved beer at the tap house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>San Francisco</Title>
    <TitleURL>usa/travel/san-francisco</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-05-16T05:11:44.423+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;We arrived in San Francisco by driving over the Golden Gate Bridge with spectacular views of the city. Once we had found our hotel we headed out to explore. The first stop was the famous winding road on Lombard street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/lombard-street.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Fran is a popular spot on the typical US tours and this did not go unnoticed as we headed down to the touristy Fisherman's Wharf area. There were restaurants selling fish, shops selling candy and t-shirts, sea lions could be seen lounging in the sun, there are arcades, an aquarium and Madam Tussards. All great,but if you swap the sea lions for donkeys then Blackpool also ticks these boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/giant-nerds-box.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the sun beginning to set we decided to go up&amp;nbsp;the Coit tower to get a good view of the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/coit-tower.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-francisco-skyline.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Fran has always been portrayed as a haven for free thinkers and activists so we were keen to get to the heart of this side of the city. We decided to take a walk through Chinatown passing Caffe Trieste where Francis Ford Coppola wrote The Godfather script. We ended up in a book shop called City Lights where there was a poetry reading being held. This was more of the San Fran we were expecting. Unfortunately neither of us have any real appreciation for poetry so we didn't stay long. &lt;br /&gt;Having done a lot of walking up and down the steep hills we decided to take the tram back to the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-fran-tram.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we were unable to get tickets to Alkatraz (you need to book a few weeks in advance, or pay over the odds with a tour company),we spent the morning walking across the bridge and the surrounding park areas. This allowed us an up close look at this architectural and engineering icon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/golden-gate-sea.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not fancying the idea of spending the afternoon in an art gallery or museum there was only one other option when stuck in a city. Drinking and eating. We headed to the nearby Pacific Heights area. We stuck to a street called Fullmore Street which was lined with trendy looking bars and restaurants which didn't have that desperate touristy look which we found at the Wharf. &lt;br /&gt;Some particular highlights were a Italian bar/restaurant called Dino and Santinos&amp;nbsp;and a simple but delicious meat and rice restaurant called Glaze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/p1000760.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its difficult being on a budget in the city but heading out early meant we were able to take advantage of the happy hour offers which run from 3-7pm in most bars in Pacifc Heights.&lt;br /&gt; This really is a must stop spot on any tour through California, its just a shame we were a bit OD'd on cities by the time we got here to fully appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Escaping Death In Death Valley</Title>
    <TitleURL>usa/travel/escaping-death-in-death-valley</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-05-18T22:05:37.337+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;We had both been regularly checking the latest weather at Yosimite and it wasn't looking good for us camping. We knew we were taking a risk planning our trip at this time of year so we weren't surprised to hear it was snowing and temperatures would reach -2oC. As the road we were planning to use to get to Las Vegas was also closed we took it as a sign that we should look for somewhere else to stay. As my dad was quick to point out, this wasn't exactly Bear Grylles mentality, however after spending our last nights camping in the cold I wasn't keen to spend 3 days in colder and wetter conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where else could we go on the way to Vegas which would be guaranteed to be hot?&amp;nbsp;Death Valley was the obvious choice. On the way we spent one night in a small beach side resort called Cayucous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/p1000840.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long drive through the desert roads we reached Furnace Creek in the afternoon. With temperatures in the mid 30's (degrees Celsius) this would certainly be hot enough for us to camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/p1000832.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon we went to watch a spectacular sunset from Zabriskie Point, with views looking over the mountains and low down badlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/p1000825.jpg" alt="Zabriskie Point sunset"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pitched our tent as the sun was beginning to set. Unfortunately our budget tent had already taken a beating and we found a hole had appeared near the entrance. Without anything to fix it I had to spend the night thinking there were snakes getting in our tent. Thankfully in the morning the local store sold duct tape. With only 3 nights of camping down and other 9 to go I am starting to get the feeling that we may be sleeping in an entire duct tape tent by the end.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our morning Roxercise session (basically using rocks as weights in an attempt to maintain some level of fitness) we headed to the Badwater Basin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/p1000864.jpg" alt="badwater basin sign"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we entered this surreal landscape of vast salt flats Karl shouts &amp;ldquo;Its a load of bollocks really&amp;rdquo;. He is referring to the number of signs which point out that this is the lowest point (in North America) at -282ft (-85.5m) below sea level. Having been to the Dead Sea in Jordan at -1360 ft (-414m) below sea level, I do kind of see his point. However, not wanting to be defeated, Death Valley does hold the record for the highest ever air temperature, reaching 57 degrees Celsius in 1913, which is pretty impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/p1000850.jpg" alt="badwater salt flat"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next stop was a short hike to Natural Bridge. This was just a 1 mile stroll but that is more than enough in the blistering heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/p1000872.jpg" alt="Natural Bridge - Death Valley"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully the Americans love a good scenic drive. So with the AC full blast our next attraction was Artists Drive. A beautiful drive through multi-hued volcanic and sedimentary hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/p1000885.jpg" alt="Artists Drive"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we had cooled off we thought we would brave the Golden Canyon Trail. This was only a short 2 mile walk but we were beaten by the mid day heat half way. I like to feel that we had done the best part of the walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/p1000882.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending some time in the cool visitor centre and with a hit of caffeine to get us going we went in search for our final stop of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/p1000896.jpg" alt="General Store - Stove PipeWells"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mesequite Flat Sand Dunes are better in the afternoon, and thankfully the sun had clouded over as they aren't the easiest to walk on. We ran, skipped and jumped our way across another diverse landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/p1000918.jpg" alt="sand dunes footsteps"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the caffeine buzz wore off we headed back to camp exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/p1000927.jpg" alt="Mesequite Flat Sand Dunes"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with camping in the Desert, apart from the snakes, scorpions and spiders, is the dust. After rolling around barefoot in the sand dunes my feet look like they will never be clean again. There is also a considerable lack of water which means that the campsite doesn't have a shower. We are forced to try and wash ourselves in the hand sinks, only to walk out into the wind and be covered with a fresh layer of muck. I thought we were looking tanned but it will probably wash off when we get to Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/p1000816.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the&amp;nbsp;sun set on the on the final night&amp;nbsp;the wind began to gust, and in the dryest place in America it began to RAIN, and it rained all night long. I was sure the tent was going to blow away but we survived and so did the tent..for now.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;We had both been regularly checking the latest weather at Yosimite and it wasn't looking good for us camping. We knew we were taking a risk planning our trip at this time of year so we weren't surprised to hear it was snowing and temperatures would reach -2oC. As the road we were planning to use to get to Las Vegas was also closed we took it as a sign that we should look for somewhere else to ...</ContentPreview>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Leaving the bright lights of Vegas behind us we set off to the first stop on our 6 day camping tour. After a few wrong turns we reached the surreal landscape of Zion just as the sun was illuminating the mountains highlighting the coloured sandstone which the valley is famous for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our camp ground may not have had a shower but it did have some friendly wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/p1010011.jpg" alt="zion campground"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we awoke for our full day of hiking the zion canyon,&amp;nbsp;I felt slightly less excited as the lack of sleep from Vegas and sleeping in a tent had caught up with me. I looked at the map and saw that there were a few short, easy walks which would do nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/p1010037.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We did not do any of these.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started promisingly enough with a gentle stroll to the Emerald Pools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/p1010021.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This walk conveniently led on to the difficult and strenuous Angel Falls walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/p1010047.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you start the walk there is no turning back half way, so along with the other hordes of sweating tourists we ploughed our way to the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/p1010043.jpg" alt="angels landing path"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully the views were spectacular which made it all worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/p1010040.jpg" alt="angels landing chain"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch we thought we would finish the day with a easy walk to the Weeping Mountain. However, once again I found myself on a steep hike to Hidden Canyon. I cant even blame Karl as the map said it was a 2mile walk so I thought that sounded great. What they didn't say was the 2 miles were vertical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/p1010063.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exhausted we still had one more site to visit. Zions grand finally is its Narrows. This is the section at the end of the Canyon where the walls close in and the river begins to flow down. These go on for up to 18miles, unfortunately most of that is waste deep in water and we didn't come prepared with waterproof trousers or shoes. We walked as far as we could without getting soaked and were still able to appreciate the scenery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/p1010064.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling like we literally couldn't walk another step of Zion Canyon we fell into a peaceful and well deserved sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;After leaving Zion our next stop on our tour of the Colorado Basin is the highly photographed Monument Valley. This image has become the icon of Western America as shown on both our Map and Lonely Planet Guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/monument-valley-22.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived at the Gouldings Camp Park in the afternoon. The park itself has it's own claim to fame as it was set up to host the movie crews which used the valley as the back drop for many Western films. In tribute to this they still have John Wayne's cabin available to visit and each night they show a film staring him in their small movie theatre. With the only other option to sit in our cold tent we decided to take them up on the offer of a John Wayne movie. The Searchers on the first night and Stage Coach (1939) on the second night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/monument-valley-15.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the day a sandstorm had passed the tent. Apparently sandstorms are another thing thing the tent wont protect you against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/monument-valley-7.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning we got up at 5.30am to drive through Monument Valley at sunrise. When we got there we found that the road was closed to all except tour buses which were full of people who had paid $76 each to have the opportunity to visit the site at this majestic hour. With no sign of guards stopping us from accessing the road we followed the bus in. Waiving the $20 fee we should have paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/monument-valley-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the bus was out of site we had the road to ourselves. Technically trespassing on the native lands I wished I hadn't watched the John Wayne film last night. You half expected a group of Native Americans to ride over on horseback throwing spears at us. Thankfully that was just my imagination. In actual fact what we had done was encourage others to drive into the site without paying as cars began to follow us in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/monument-valley-16.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning sun was the best light to capture these amazing rock formations. As we followed the road round the back of the site we were able to catch the same photo that had been stolen for our blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/monument-valley-18.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another day. Another great photo opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Honey I'v left the car keys in the Grand Canyon</Title>
    <TitleURL>usa/travel/honey-i'v-left-the-car-keys-in-the-grand-canyon</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-05-27T18:25:37.38+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;It may not be the biggest, it may not be the deepest or the widest, but its certainly the grandest&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; said the overly exaggerated American voice as we sat watching the grand canyon welcome video in the multi million pound visitor centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/grand-canyon-(2).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here we are at the Grand Canyon, and it looks like everyone else is as well, in their freshly washed garments. We however are into our 5th day of camping feeling a little dishevelled to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick day trip around the visitor center, a walk along the canyon rim and &amp;nbsp;several spectacular views of the canyon and we decide its time for some beers to escape the crowds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/grand-canyon-(16).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We awoke early in the morning with the plan to hike down into the canyon. The Bright Angel Trail was the most popular and it had water filling stations along the way so it seemed the most sensible choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/grand-canyon-(17).jpg" alt="bright angel trail head sign"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walk we were going to do was graded 'difficult' and would take 4 to 6 hours. This hike was different in that you walk down first then walk back up, around 250 people each year don't make it back up presumably they must be rescued by a donkey. There's warnings everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/grand-canyon-(11).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we descended with out much of an issue, the further we go the less people there is until we are almost on our own. The way back up is much harder, the sun is shining bright and there is little shade several hours later and feeling really tired we make it to the top but the celebrations were to be short lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/grand-canyon-(24).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we approached the car I joked that I had left the car keys in the Grand Canyon, however the joke was on me. As I rummaged through my bag. I wondered where my jacket was,&amp;rdquo;&lt;em&gt;its not here Leanne&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Where's the car keys&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;rdquo;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Eh, In the jacket&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All our worldly possessions were in the car and we had no way to get in. The car keys were lost somewhere in the Grand Canyon! I was in the shit and Leanne let me know about. Leanne was looking for the lost and found but I had no choice, I had to go back down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/grand-canyon-(25).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the warnings for a trip the length I was about to complete, for the secound time, I would not only be the donkey who left his keys in the grand canyon I would be coming back out strapped around its back. I set out the sound of Leanne screaming &amp;ldquo;I hope you don't come back&amp;rdquo; still buzzing through my ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With aching legs and no idea whether I would find the keys let alone get back up. I set out back down the canyon. Leanne was to wait at the top and see if anyone picked the jacket up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sun was at its highest as I ran down the trail, past the crowds. Some cheered as they stepped out the way, some laughed and some warned me not to trip. As the people became less and less I reached the first shelter. No Jacket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/grand-canyon-(4).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on I went to the final shelter. If there was no jacket there I may as well have continued on into the canyon, never to return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that was not to be, there hanging up in the shelter at the furthest point on our walk was the jacket. I quickly found the keys, I knew it was going to be okay. Leanne however did not and I still had out to get out the Grand Canyon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Leanne worried, I set out to climb out the Grand Canyon for the second time in one day. A light jog turned into a fast walk. The half way point appeared and I continued through the blistering heat. I had to let Leanne know it was going to be okay. It was hard, really hard but there was no way the donkey was coming for me. Stumbling out of the Grand Canyon amongst the crowds of visitors I looked for Leanne and waved, I had the keys and she jumped for joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had only been away two hours, setting the new world record for finding keys on the Bright Angel Trail. Three days later my legs are still in pain. But hey you cant be the hero when you started the fire!&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;It may not be the biggest, it may not be the deepest or the widest, but its certainly the grandest&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; said the overly exaggerated American voice as we sat watching the grand canyon welcome video in the multi million pound visitor centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/grand-canyon-(2).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Breaking the law in Jerome, The Californian Coast and Los Angeles</Title>
    <TitleURL>usa/travel/breaking-the-law-in-jerome-the-californian-coast-and-los-angeles</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-06-03T00:06:08.037+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;After 6 days of camping through wind, rain and sandstorms we were more than ready for a bed and a room which didn't have the possibility of blowing away in the night. We choose to stay in a small historic town in Arizona called Jerome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/jermoetola-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1876 Jerome is a revived Ghost Town which was abandoned for many years after the Gold and Copper Mines closed in the 1950's. Once referred to as the Wickedest Town in the West Jerome now acts as snapshot to this historic time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/jermoetola-9.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the&amp;nbsp;mining ended in the 1950s the population of 15000 left to find work elsewhere, leaving their houses behind and Jerome become a ghost town. The town has now been revived with the arrival of hippies, musicans, poets and artists. Jerome is a quircky cool place to hang out and very different from the highly comercialised, all look the same, american towns we have&amp;nbsp;visited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/jermoetola-13.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming from England its hard to be impressed with American history as many of the buildings date from the 1930's. One 'museum' looked like a typical scrapyard in Blyth. However, the town is set on top of Cleopatra Hill (5,200ft), the sun was shining and there was plenty of wine to be tasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/jermoetola-12.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside to our stay in Jerome was the parking fine we received when we went to leave. Apparently there are laws dictating which direction you need to park. Needless to say Karl wasn't too happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/jermoetola-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Big Sur&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two long days of driving we finally made our way back to the Californian Coast. We drove up the famously scenic Highway 101 to reach the Big Sur National Park where we spent two nights camping, walking and relaxing on the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/jermoetola-17.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/jermoetola-29.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our last stop on our American Itinerary was LA. The city of Angels. Or more like, the city of crazy people who talk to themselves. We cant comment too much on LA. We only had one day there before our flight so just stayed around our hotel which was based in Hollywood. We saw the sign, saw the stars and then swifty left America behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/jermoetola-34.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next stop Mexico City.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;After 6 days of camping through wind, rain and sandstorms we were more than ready for a bed and a room which didn't have the possibility of blowing away in the night. We choose to stay in a small historic town in Arizona called Jerome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/jermoetola-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1876 Jerome is a revived Ghost Town which was abandoned...</ContentPreview>

    <Title>Teotihuacan - The place where the gods were created</Title>
    <TitleURL>mexico/travel/teotihuacan-the-place-where-the-gods-were-created</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-06-07T01:42:16.647+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;50km north of Mexico City lies the ancient ruins of Teotithucan, to get there you can get the bus from the Del Norte bus terminal. However in recent years this bus has been the target of armed robbers which is highlighted in the guide book. Not to be put off we leave all our valuables in the hotel safe and then navigated the city's underground metro system to find the bus station, for only 5 pesos [20p] you can go anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/teotihuacan-(10).jpg" alt="teotihuacan pyramid of the sun"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much is known about Teotihucan (The place where the gods were created), the earliest buildings date back to 200 BC and the Temple of the Sun was completed in AD 100. This makes Teotihucan one of the earliest examples of Meso-American history, predating the Aztecs (Mexicas) by well over 1000 years. This city reached its peak in 450AD housing some 150000 people and by around 450AD was completely abandoned, though there are many theory's as to why no one really knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/teotihuacan-(14).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we walked along the Avenue of the Dead looming in the distance half way along is the Pyramid of the Sun, the 3rd largest pyramid in the world. At the end is the Pyramid of the Moon, around half the size and surrounded by 12 smaller pyramids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/teotihuacan-(1).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the front of the pyramid of the sun is a set of steeps stairs leading to the top. I don't know whether it is the pollution in Mexico city, the altitude or lack of fitness but it turns out to be more tiring climbing those stairs than it looks. Its worth it though as at the top you are rewarded with scenic views of the entire site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We soon noticed that people weren't just interested in the temples, as a Chinese man sneakily takes photos of Karl. We spot him again with his oversized lens pointing up at us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/teotihuacan-(4).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we arrived at the bottom of the pyramids a couple of Mexican girls ask in Spanish for their photo taken with us, not really sure what their saying we pose for a photo with them anyway. About 2 minutes later a group of school kids have surrounded us, asking questions and giving us questionnaires to complete. Then, what a surprise, they want their photos taken with us. Surely the pyramids are more interesting than two white people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/teotihuacan-(8).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After escaping all the attention we continue along the avenue of the dead to the Pyramid of the Moon, climbing the incredibly steep stairs gives spectacular views along the Avenue of the Dead, the sheer size of the Temple of the Sun can really be appreciated from this vantage point. The only problem is we now have to get back down!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/teotihuacan-(12).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a quick tour around some of the partially preserved palaces and the on-site museum we get the bus back hoping once again not to be robbed. Having learnt a little of Mexican history we arrive safely back in Mexico city.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>5 Days In Mexico City</Title>
    <TitleURL>mexico/travel/5-days-in-mexico-city</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-06-07T02:05:30.83+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Leaving our American road trip behind we arrive in Mexico City ready to spend a few days relaxing. Unfortunately Mexico city has other ideas. We are greeted with the sound of people shouting and car horns blasting. With a population of 20 million the streets are ram packed and we are happy to be dropped off in a fairly secluded square where our hostel is located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/mexico-city-6.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hostel may be basic but it has a roof top bar which serves bottles of beer for &amp;pound;1. Its nice to finally meet other travellers with stories of places to visit in Mexico and South America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/mexico-city-21.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few days of R&amp;amp;R we are ready to face the chaos. Our hostel is conveniently located in the Downtown Historic district where the main square (Zocalo) and many of the museums are located. When we get there we are met by half of the police force of Mexico in full riot gear. We have heard Mexico is unsafe but this seems a bit much! Apparently this isn't for the tourists, we just happen to be in the city while the presidential elections are being held and there are numerous people who want to protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/mexico-city-16.jpg" alt="mexico city zocolo with flag"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would think the number of police officers would make us feel safe, however the next day we saw a police man punch a guy in the face and throw him to the floor in front of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/mexico-city-5.jpg" alt="Huge Mexican Flag"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent most of the day at Templo Mayor, an ancient Aztec temple which they have uncovered under the city. It is an important place as it was here the people are said to have saw an eagle, perched on a cactus with a snake in its beak which symbolised the centre of the universe. This is also the image which is at the centre of the Mexican flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/mexico-city-9.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next stop was our &lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/mexico/travel/teotihuacan-the-place-where-the-gods-were-created/" target="_blank"&gt;trip to Teotihucan&lt;/a&gt;. This day was slightly spoiled by our hostel room key being pick pocketed on the metro. Hopefully this is the only crime we encounter during our trip through Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before leaving the city we spent a day in the National Museum of Anthropology. The excellent galleries and displays will tell you everything you would ever need to know about the peoples of Mesoamerica. The diversity of the peoples and history in this area is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/mexico-city-day-5-2.jpg" alt=" National Museum of Anthropology Waterfall fountain"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we had absorbed as much as our brains could handle we headed out to the nearby park which felt more like a fairground with crowds of people selling hotdogs, candyfloss and popcorn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/mexico-city-day-5-9.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the petty theft and policeman assault Mexico City is still a great place to visit. The locals we have spoken to have been friendly, funny and helpful. Even with our awful attempts at speaking Spanish. Unfortunately this isn't the relaxing place we are searching for so after 5 days we head South in search of peace, quite and more Tequilla.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Mezcal</Title>
    <TitleURL>mexico/drink-reviews/mezcal</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-06-10T00:30:02.647+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;We had been forced dry for 2 days as the Mexican government banned the sale of alcohol during the weekend of the presidential elections. So as Monday dawned we felt detoxed and ready to sample Mexico's poison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/mezcal-1.jpg" alt="mezcal wheel against wall"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are currently residing in Oaxaca where you can't go down a street without seeing at least 7 different signs advertising Mezcal. This popular liquor is worshipped among locals who derive the alcohol from the Agave plants which grow the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/mezcal-2.jpg" alt="agave plant"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a full day of sightseeing we finally stop off at a the El Rey de Matatlan distillery where we are shown some of the varieties of Agave which they use to make Mezcal. This is followed by a short tour outlining the process. The first step is to harvest the plant when it reaches maturity (6-8 year), the root, or Pinas (named because it looks like a pineaple), are then baked in kilns dug into the ground lined with hot rocks and covered in soil to absorb the flavours of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/mezcal-5.jpg" alt="mezcal kiln full"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After baking for 3 days the Agave are placed in a stone mill where they are ground. The pulp is then transferred to wooden vats where water is added. This allows it to ferment naturally for 3-15 days before being distilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/mezcal-7.jpg" alt="mezcal mill wheel"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we get to taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are initially given 4 bottles to try ranging from the Joven Mescal, which is young and unaged,to Mescal Anejo, which has been aged for 8 years. It is the latter which we try first. They say this is the smoothest but it tastes like a cheep smoky whiskey to me. I'm not a fan but willing to try more to see how the other lesser aged variety's taste. Unfortunately they don't differ too much from the first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/mezcal-13.jpg" alt="mezcal tasting"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shots are served with some side dishes to help balance the taste. The options are; Lime, Nuts, Chilli Powder or a Worm. The worm is actually a Gusano, a moth caterpillar which feeds on the Agave. One of these is placed in each bottle of aged Mezcal. The tradition is that whoever gets the worm in their shot glass has to drink it. I don't think this is a forfeit as we see many Mexicans munching these down voluntarily from the side plates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/mezcal-10.jpg" alt="mezca worm in bottle"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find out later that the 'Chilli' powder is actually called Sal de Gusano, or 'Worm Salt' in English. This powder is made up of chilli, salt and dried worms. They really do love these little fellows!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/mezcal-11.jpg" alt="mezcal worm in bottle"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of research we buy a bottle of the Roposado [40%], which is aged for 6 months in American white oak barrels giving it a amber colour. We also go for and a much more a palatable drink, Pistachio Crema [19%], which uses the young distilled liquor, sweetened with honey and then flavoured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/mezcal-15.jpg" alt="mezcal bottles"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two shots into the Reposado and we are grabbing at the bag of Sal de Gusano. It really does say something about the drink if we are using dried worms to get rid of the taste of the Mezcal.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Oaxaca- Cultural Home To The Zapotecs</Title>
    <TitleURL>mexico/travel/oaxaca-cultural-home-to-the-zapotecs</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-06-10T14:46:12.557+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Pronounced somthing like 'waahaka', Oaxaca State is in the south of Mexico on the Pacific side. After a 6 hour bus journey from Mexico City we arrive in Oaxaca City, its a beautiful spanish colonial town in the Oaxaca highlands surounded by lush green mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/oaxaca-1.jpg" alt="oaxaca street"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, its election day in Mexico and several military helicpoters are letting their presence be known by circling overhead, there is a protest in the main square about the the massacre of 41 students in neighouring Guerrrero state by local drug gangs, the gangs are claimed to be working with the police force which the current government failed to act upon. Here in Oaxaca a group of teachers stole some of the ballot boxes and burnt them in the square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/oaxaca-33.jpg" alt="oaxaca street"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politics aside Oaxaca has a rustic charm about the place, cobblestone streets and Spanish colonial buildings make up the streets with a peppering of historic churches thrown into the mix. This place feels more touristy than Mexico City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/oaxaca-34.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oaxaca and the surrounding villages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Santa Maria Del Tule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a nice little village with a colonial style town hall. However its big claim to fame is its incredibly large tule tree, at 2000 years old its claimed to be the worlds largest with diameter of 40m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/oaxaca-4.jpg" alt="santa maria del tule church"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its certainly very wide and shadows the nearby church but to be honest although its pretty cool I have seen enough trees lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/oaxaca-5.jpg" alt="del tule"   /&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Textile Making- The Red Gold of Oaxaca&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oaxaca is famed for its textile making particularly its bright multi-coloured rugs. Red and purple can be created from the parasites found on certain cactuses, said the little old lady at the front, we were then given what looked like white pebbles and when you rub it on your hand it turns red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/oaxaca-10.jpg" alt="oaxaca textile factory"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1500s the spanish arrvied looking for gold. Instead they found what is known as the the red gold of Oaxaca. It was imported back into Europe to colour the clothes of the ruling classes who were the only ones who could afford it. The rugs are still handmade in the same way today which of course means we cant afford them either!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hierve el Agua &amp;ndash; The petrified waterfall and fresh water springs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Hierveel Aqua there are two fresh water pools placed in the most scenic of places, what else is there to do but go for a swim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/oaxaca-12.jpg" alt="hierve el agua"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hierve el Agua means &amp;ldquo;the water boils&amp;rdquo; in spanish which is surprising as the water is actually cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/oaxaca-25.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This place was a great surprise and is incredibly beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/oaxaca-23.jpg" alt="hierve el agua pool tree"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the distance you can see the petrified water fall, created over thousands of years by water rich in calcium carbonate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/oaxaca-14.jpg" alt="Hierve el agua"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitla&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitla&amp;nbsp;is an old Zapotec city with interesting and unique patterns built into the brick work, worth a look if your passing but not as good a Monte Alban, although you are permitted to go inside a few of the old tombs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/oaxaca-28.jpg" alt="Mitla main temple"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oaxaca has been a culturaly interesting place considering that before this trip we had never even heard of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All cultured out its time to hit the beach, the next stop is&amp;nbsp;Oaxaca coastal town and surfers paradise, Puerto Escondido.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>The Jeweled Skull of Monte Alban</Title>
    <TitleURL>mexico/world-history/the-jeweled-skull-of-monte-alban</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-06-12T01:12:42.663+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;The jewled skull of Monte Alban reminds me of certain piece of art by Damien Hirst, except this was made thousands of years before. Partially covered in jade with fake eyes and nose this strange mix of art and death&amp;nbsp;was found in the tombs of Monte Alban. It now resides in the Museo de las culturas de Oaxaca.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/monte-alban-25.jpg" alt="Jeweled skull of monte alban"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 50 peso bus ride from Oaxaca and you are at Monte Alban, the ancient home to the Zapotec&amp;nbsp;people. Founded in 500BC and eventually being abandoned in 850AD its one of the best examples of meso american history and is now a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/415" target="_blank"&gt;UNISCO world heritage site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/monte-alban-4.jpg" alt="Monte Alban"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the more peculiar specimens on site are the carved rocks dating from 500-100bc that show men with their penis's being removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/monte-alban-14.jpg" alt="monte alban"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built on top of a flattened mountain the views of the surrounding valleys are spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/monte-alban-6.jpg" alt="monte alban"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now it appears to be ran by lizards...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/monte-alban-12.jpg" alt="igauana on a rock"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again the history and culture of Mexico has surprised us greatly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Puerto Escondido</Title>
    <TitleURL>mexico/travel/puerto-escondido</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-06-23T21:43:11.843+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;We awoke from our makeshift beds as the sun rose, the light reflected the ocean revealing for the first time the deep blue water beyond the sand. As the waves crashed against the shore the first of the day&amp;rsquo;s surfers sprang into action. Shortly after came the middle aged hippies jogging, making the most of the cooler morning air. It feels good. We have made it to this little bit of paradise. Perhaps sleeping rough is not so bad after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/puerto-escondido-31.jpg" alt="puerto escondido sunset"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pacific Buddha Hostel is perhaps the cleanest hostel we have ever been to. It is ran by a couple from Canada and Argentina who met whilst travelling. It has a cool relaxed hippy vibe which is perfect for a chilled out stay at the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/puerto-escondido-28.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The morning sunshine is short lived, a hurricane off the pacific coast has brought torrential rain and winds. There is so much rain the roads turn to rivers. So with little else to do we wait at the beach bar chilling in the hammocks. We soon find out the bar also acts as the local zoo with numerous animals, including a deer, to keep us company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/puerto-escondido-6.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being typical Brits when it rains there is no better excuse to drink. So when there&amp;rsquo;s a break in the rain we rush to the shop to pick up supplies and head back to the hostel. It appears we are not the only ones with this idea. And so it continues for the next few days. Sun and sunbathing in the morning, rain and beers in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Puerto Escondido is famous for its surf, attracting both professional and amateurs alike. The waves here are as big as we have ever seen. The surfers say they are about 6 metres. Fantastic to look at, from a distance, but there is no way we are going in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/puerto-escondido-10.jpg" alt="puerto escondio zicatella"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are later told that not long ago the waves reached 60ft high. If you&amp;rsquo;re like us and can&amp;rsquo;t imagine waves this big than check out this video filmed last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.surfline.com/surflinetv/featured-clips/maxed-puerto-escondido_127013" target="_blank"&gt;Puerto Escondido 60ft Waves&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days the rains pass and the sea looks less ferocious. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s okay to go for a swim. This notion is quickly reversed when a wave twice the size of an adult male crashes down on you. It hurts and shocks simultaneously. Best leave the surfing to the professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/puerto-escondido-37.jpg" alt="escondido sunset"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a place you don&amp;rsquo;t want to leave. Some of the guys in the hostel have been here for weeks. At around 5 pounds each per night it&amp;rsquo;s more about how long you have got than how much it costs. After 5 nights we reluctantly decide to leave. Looking rather red and with a broken laptop we set out on the 14 hour bus ride to the mountain town of San Cristobal de Las Casas.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>San Cristobal de las Casas</Title>

    <DateCreated>2015-06-24T00:03:58.673+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Waking from a satisfying sleep we look out the bus window, the clouds are resting in the valley below, a picture of serenity. The coming of the morning light means the 14 hour bus journey must be drawing to a conclusion, perhaps only 1 or 2 hours left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-christobol-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;San Cristobal, a Spanish colonial city, sits at 2800m above sea level and is remarkably colder than Puerto Escondido.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cold and the long bus journey have really got to us and all we really want to do is rest and eat some food. A quick tour of the centre is about all we can muster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-christobol-7.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The altitude is noticeable when climbing the two hills within the city, however reaching the top gives a good view of the historic centre and surrounding area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-christobol-10.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each afternoon we get caught out in torrential rain. Having to wait at whatever location we happened to be at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-christobol-17.jpg" alt="san cristobal rain"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a massive indigenous population here. Leanne is a good foot taller than some of the locals which makes me look like a massive white giant. It&amp;rsquo;s a real shame we didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to visit the surrounding indigenous villages. We are told you can see them sacrifice chickens in daily ceremonies and that they are almost permanently drunk on cheap moonshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-christobol-4.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite our not so eventful stopover San Cristobal remains a hot spot for travellers looking for work. Many travellers are working for hostels for their bed and food. Some we speak to have been here for months. But this is not for us, if we wanted rain and cold we would have stayed in England.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Around Palenque - Into the Jungle</Title>
    <TitleURL>mexico/travel/around-palenque-into-the-jungle</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-06-24T15:59:03.823+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;We arrived at Palenque after a 6 hour bus ride from San Cristobal. We had been advised not to stay in the town centre but to head to the traveller hang out of El Panchan, located near to the entrance of the ruins. Its beautiful location is not the only reason it is popular with the traveller crowd as it is well known for selling mushrooms of the more magic variety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/palenque-jungle-(2).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we didn't have any accommodation booked we got the taxi to drop us off somewhere so we could find a room. Located in a dense forest, in 30 degree heat, the last thing you want to do is trek around with a heavy backpack so we head to the first sign offering accommodation, promisingly called Jungle Palace. The man at the entrance said rooms were 250 Paso with a bathroom. A bargain! I cautiously ask to have a look at this so called 'palace'. We were then led to a makeshift ply building, 10ft in the air, trying to pass off as some sort of tree house. We walk up the stairs to have a look inside. You don't have to be an expert in construction to see that this building was not structurally sound and its decor can only be described as rustic, at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/palenque-jungle-(9).jpg" alt="jungle palace"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karl looks around and says it to looks fine. I'm less keen. The place doesn't even have walls. Half of it is covered in some sort or mesh with gaping holes in. I would be a feast for the mosquitoes. I set off in search for something better with moans from Karl that I need to make my standards more realistic. Luckily 20m further into the jungle I spot a well-kept patch, a lush stream and freshly painted white concrete walls. We have stumbled upon Margareta and Eds oasis. For 70 Paso's more than the jungle palace (aprox &amp;pound;3) we are lead to possibly the cleanest room we have stayed in so far. It has a cool blue decor, a large comfortable bed and beautiful pattered floor tiles which you could eat off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bask in my triumph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/palenque-jungle-(1).jpg" alt="el panchan room"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karl is still trying to protest that if we were true budget backpackers we would have stayed in the tree house and had the full jungle experience. I tell him he is free to go stay there himself while I sleep in my luxury insect proof fortress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As if this place couldn't get any better, the owner is the nicest woman and my new favourite person as she told me I look the same age as her granddaughter who is 14. Unfortunately there were no similar comments made to Karl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/palenque-jungle-(5).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;El Panchan is not like anywhere we have been before. Secluded in the jungle you can hear the sounds of the howler monkeys screeching overhead to the background&amp;nbsp;tune of a thousand insects. In the evening we venture out in search of food. There are only 2 options available one is a very basic bar and burger van which we stop off at first, for happy hour. A short walk further takes you to the epicentre of El Panchan, Don Muchos is a large restaurant set around a stage with a live band playing atmospheric drum beats. It's perfect. The place was sold to us as a hippy hang out, and there are certainly a few spaced out dreadlocks knocking around. However we are surprised to see a&amp;nbsp;number of Mexican family's here. As the night goes on we are treated to Salsa and fire dancing. The atmosphere in the place is like a holiday resort and we almost forget we are backpacking as we order more glasses of wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Misol-Hal and Agua Azul&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feeling slightly worse for wear after a night of indulgences we went on a tour to the local waterfalls. Or efforts were well worth it as we were rewarded with the spectacular sights of Misol-Ha and Agua Azul. At a height of 35m the nearby Misol-Ha waterfall cascades into the deep pool surrounded by dark green jungle with exotic plants. You can experience the sheer force of the water as you walk along the back of the falls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/palenque-jungle-(21).jpg" alt="misol hal waterfall"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next we head to Agua Azul which, despite the influx of tourists, was simply beautiful. As we swam in the turquoise waters I found myself staring at the falls, the place looked so familiar. I had read many travel magazines, books and websites before this trip and this place felt as though we had both been dropped onto page from one of the magazines photographs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/palenque-jungle-(23).jpg" alt="agua azul waterfalls"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A splash in these waters was the perfect remedy for a hangover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/palenque-jungle-(27).jpg" alt="swimming agua azul"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say we had an enchanting experience in the jungle. With the magnificent Mayan ruins to explore and epic waterfalls on our doorstep. Mexico has once again produced another gem for us.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;We arrived at Palenque after a 6 hour bus ride from San Cristobal. We had been advised not to stay in the town centre but to head to the traveller hang out of El Panchan, located near to the entrance of the ruins. Its beautiful location is not the only reason it is popular with the traveller crowd as it is well known for selling mushrooms of the more magic variety.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Another Mexican state, another set of pre-Hispanic ruins for us to explore. This time we had entered the realm of the Mayans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/palenque-ruins-(3).jpg" alt="palenque big temple"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Palenque, one of the most important Mayan cities of the Classical Period (250 to 900 A.D) was the capital of a powerful dynasty that ruled the modern day states of Chiapas and Tabasco. It is famous for is architectural and sculptural works as well as the well preserved hieroglyphic inscriptions that have been used to provide invaluable information to help understand the history of this culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/palenque-ruins-(16).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set within the backdrop of the dense jungle this is like no other ruins we have visited so far on our trip. As we explore further we find more treasures to be discovered in the trees which have hidden the temples for hundreds of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/palenque-ruins-(32).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a magical feel abut the place with butterflies of all colours and sizes dancing around our feet as we walk the steps to get the best views of the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/palenque-ruins-(34).jpg" alt="palenque temple"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our visit quickly becomes a feat of endurance as the blistering heat and humidity prevents us from walking. We are briefly treated to the luxury of the small air-conditioned museum only to exit to a wall of heat and air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/palenque-ruins-(27).jpg" alt="palenque view from stairs"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The site is huge but most of it is still being excavated, thankfully the main temples only cover a small area. We leave this historical wonderland dripping with sweat, ready to jump quickly into an ice cold shower.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Journey to Puerto Escondido - The Disco Bus From Hell</Title>
    <TitleURL>mexico/travel/journey-to-puerto-escondido-the-disco-bus-from-hell</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-06-24T22:34:24.493+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;The air conditioned luxury night bus from Oaxaca to Puerto Escondido turned out to be a mini bus, perhaps the leg room was spacious to a Mexican. To a six foot tall European there simply was no leg room. Ryan Air feels like luxury compared to this. Leanne of course has no such issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feeling we might have misjudged this one quickly becomes apparent. The bus's suspension is clearly overly stretched on the bumpy, winding mountain road. We have a 10 hour journey through the night to look forward to and I&amp;rsquo;m not going to sleep a wink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/escondido-(1).jpg" alt="puerto esconidio boat on beach"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Despite this the other passengers are fast asleep and snoring. Leanne is drifting off into a peaceful slumber. How this is possible is beyond me, the driver is pumping out 80s and 90s classic pop. George Michael, Michael Jackson, &amp;ldquo;Girls just wanna have fun&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s the original party bus except I am the only one awake to live through this nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But things get worse, the bus feels like a roller-coaster. Left then right, left then right again, winding through mountain roads in total darkness. It&amp;rsquo;s no good pretending, IM SICK, really sick. TRAVEL SICK! And there&amp;rsquo;s another 8 hours left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I move to the window seat for some fresh air. I&amp;rsquo;m sweating with my top off to the sound track of &amp;ldquo;gimme gimme your man&amp;rdquo; blasting out the speakers. The world is twisting, turning, spinning, trying not to be sick. The bus driver stops for a break and I stumble off the bus and vomit all over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its 3 in the morning and we are half way there. Reluctantly I get back on the bus, the driver is still playing loud music, now its &amp;ldquo;Some-where-over-the-rainbow&amp;rdquo;. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel long until the road straightens, we have arrived, but it&amp;rsquo;s still dark. Its half four in the morning, we were supposed to arrive at 7am. We can&amp;rsquo;t check into the hostel until 11am. &amp;ldquo;The mini-bus only takes six hours&amp;rdquo; the guy at the bus station kindly informed us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/escondido-(2).jpg" alt="playa punta sun set"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not surprisingly there&amp;rsquo;s no answer at the hostel. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing else to do but sleep rough. Finding our way by starlight, guided by the crashing sounds of the waves we arrive at an empty beach bar, as Leanne reads her book I catch some much needed sleep on a sun lounger. With the world still spinning night turned into morning. The sun slowly rises and lights up the ocean as early morning surfers head into the surf. It&amp;rsquo;s clearly all been worth it as we appear to have found a little bit of paradise.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;So we have finally made it to the Yucatan Peninsula, our first stop is the cultural capital of the state Merida. Originally home to 5 Mayan pyramids which were dismantled by the Spanish conquistadors. The limestone blocks were then reused to build many of the colonial buildings standing today. Not surprisingly the city does feel like you could have stepped off the bus in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/merida-4.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The town is a popular spot for backpackers as it is close to a number of sites and activities including, visits to Cenotes, the ruins of Uxmal or to go flamingo watching. Out of the 4 nights we spend here we didn&amp;rsquo;t participate in any of these. Instead we choose to take advantage of the hostels pool and hammocks. As well as the free cooking, salsa and yoga classes. Add in several bottles of Corona and the 4 nights quickly passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/merida-14.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We left feeling relaxed, stretched, suntanned and thankfully with a new laptop.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Chichen Itza - Is this one of the wonders of the world?</Title>
    <TitleURL>mexico/world-history/chichen-itza-is-this-one-of-the-wonders-of-the-world</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-06-28T20:03:57.943+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;We decide to spend 2 nights in Valladolid, Yucatans third-largest city, as it is only a short 30min bus ride from Chichen Itza. The town centre is pleasant enough and there are a number of cheap places to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/valladolid-4.jpg" alt="valladolid church"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrive at Chichen Itza just as the hordes of tourist busses descend among the site. The ruins are the most famous and well preserved in Mexico. Being named as one of the 7 wonders of the modern world it also means it attracts many visitors who want to tick another one off their list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entrance comprises of a huge car park and modern ticket office, complete with market, gift shop, restaurant, ice cream store and a bar. With hundreds of sun burnt holiday makers clogging up the queues this feels more like the entrance to a theme park than an archaeological site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/chichen-itza-7.jpg" alt="chichen itza crowds"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the mob we manage to squeeze in and get our first glimpse of El Castillo (Pyramid of Kukulcan), which was used as a Mayan calendar, with 365 steps to the top reflecting the number of days in the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/chichen-itza-4.jpg" alt="chichen itza main temple"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The site also has the grand Juego de Pelota, which was used by the Mayans as a ball court. Here you can be amused by the number of people walking around clapping away (the sound echoes several times). But if seen from a distance it looks like the hordes of humans have turned into performing seals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/chichen-itza-10.jpg" alt="chichen itza ball court"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with the number of people it is hard not to be impressed by the site, the restoration work allows us to create a better image of what life would have been like when the city was at its peak. However, Chichen Itza does lack the grandeur of Theotithican and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the same lush backdrop as Palenque or the peaceful tranquillity of Monte Alban. It may be the most famous but we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily say it was the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/chichen-itza-26.jpg" alt="chichen itza carving"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending more time taking photographs of the local iguanas than the ruins we are beginning to feel like we may be a bit over dosed on temples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/chichen-itza-24.jpg" alt="iguana at chichen itza"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decide to push further to the coast. It&amp;rsquo;s time to party in Cancun.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Bronco in Cancun</Title>
    <TitleURL>mexico/drink-reviews/bronco-in-cancun</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-07-02T21:07:30.947+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;So we are in Cancun, other backpackers say it not very good but we thought we knew best. A quick look in the local bars and the drinks are so much more expensive than the rest of Mexico. You can get a room for a night elsewhere in Mexico for the price you pay here for a cocktail or two beers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/cancun-4.jpg" alt="cancun beach"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As budget backpackers this is not acceptable. So we go to a local Mexican shop and find the cheapest drink on the shelf. It&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;Bronco &amp;ndash; Destilado De Cana&amp;rdquo; and it costs only 13 Pesos, about 50 pence. You can pay more for a bottle of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/cancun-2.jpg" alt="bronco monnshine closeup"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s in a small plastic bottle, perhaps it looks more like a bottle of cheap pop then an alcoholic drink. It&amp;rsquo;s 25% alcohol and you get 500ml. I feel this would be at the top of an alcoholic&amp;rsquo;s daily wish list.&lt;br /&gt;On the front there is a picture of a horse running through what looks like grass. &amp;ldquo;Destilado De Cana&amp;rdquo; loosely translates to distilled from cane, what we are about to drink is distilled from sugar cane molasses. Put another way its moonshine!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/cancun-1.jpg" alt="bronco moonshine"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a drink to be drank straight. We opt for a high sugar lemonade as a mixer in the hope to sweeten the taste. The bottle of pop happens to cost more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/cancun-10.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its smells a bit like cheap whiskey mixed with paint stripper. However when the mixer is added it tastes damn good. It&amp;rsquo;s easy enough to drink and for the price is an absolute bargain, however in the morning our livers might have a different opinion.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;So we are in Cancun, other backpackers say it not very good but we thought we knew best. A quick look in the local bars and the drinks are so much more expensive than the rest of Mexico. You can get a room for a night elsewhere in Mexico for the price you pay here for a cocktail or two beers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Finding Paradise - Isla Holbox</Title>
    <TitleURL>mexico/travel/finding-paradise-isla-holbox</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-07-04T22:39:46.64+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;There are two Islands close to Cancun which are said to tick all the boxes of paradise. The closest and larger island is the Isla Mujeres (Island of Women). Despite its promising name we saw many&amp;nbsp;tours offered from Cancun and we felt we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to join the two week tourist band wagon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second option is the slightly more remote and less developed Isla Holbox, which had been mentioned to us by several other backpackers. With the promise of stretches of white sand to ourselves we decide this is the island we want to head to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isla-holbox-21.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a four hour journey via second class bus we arrive at the town Chiquilla and swiftly pay for a speed boat to take us to the island. After a half hour bumpy ride we arrive at the harbour, find our hostel and prepare to explore Isla Holbox&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isla-holbox-3.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We take a walk by the wooden Caribbean style houses with their thatched roofs. Along the sand roads coconuts hang from the palms which wave in the gentle breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The almost empty beaches appear endless, the sand is white and powdery and the shallow turquoise Caribbean Sea allows you to wade out 100 meters or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isla-holbox-11.jpg" alt="isla holbox endless beach"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The island is only 500m to 2 km wide and is 30km long. Most of this is part of the Yum Balam nature reserve which protects a large portion of the island from development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is perfect, a hidden paradise that still manages to escape the packs of tourists that descend on Cancun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isla-holbox-15.jpg" alt="holbox boat on beach"   /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no cars driving around. The main form of transport here is the humble golf cart. However, if you are fit and healthy everything is in close walking distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isla-holbox-23.jpg" alt="holbox sunset"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not not much to do here except relax and enjoy the surroundings. Crystal clear waters, sun, sea, sand and a few beers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isla-holbox-sunset-2.jpg" alt="isla holbox pier sunset"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Swimming with Whales Sharks and Turtles on Isla Holbox</Title>
    <TitleURL>mexico/travel/swimming-with-whales-sharks-and-turtles-on-isla-holbox</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-07-05T00:49:20.577+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s early in the morning and the tropical air is still cool, we are given life jackets and we jump aboard our ride. A speed boat in which the captain promises us we are going to swim with whale sharks. We are sceptical as spotting wildlife can be unpredictable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isla-holbox-whaleshark-tour-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We ride for one hour. When we leave the sun is shining but halfway into the trip we are flying through mist, the sea looks soft and silky. Like a scene from Moby dick we are searching the open seas in search of whales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isla-holbox-whaleshark-tour-12.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fog lifts, there is no land in sight and in front of us is a fin. Perhaps the fin of a dolphin, but no. As we get close the view of this magnificent creature can be seen under the waves. It&amp;rsquo;s the length of our boat with an open mouth that could swallow you whole and we are supposed to swim with it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isla-holbox-whaleshark-tour-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out the whale shark does not eat humans, thank god. Its mouth is open because it filters out plankton by continuously passing sea water through its mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isla-holbox-whaleshark-tour-9.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are first up to jump in. That in itself is daunting this far out at sea with no land in sight, not only that, there&amp;rsquo;s the odd jelly fish. We are assured they don&amp;rsquo;t sting, but we are not stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isla-holbox-whaleshark-tour-10.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look down in the ocean and see the mouth of the whale shark coming to swallow me up, it&amp;rsquo;s so close and it&amp;rsquo;s coming fast. I swim as fast as I can away, so much for swimming with whale sharks it&amp;rsquo;s more like swimming away from them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isla-holbox-whaleshark-tour-14.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leanne however is dragged along by the boat captain and swims gracefully side by side with the whale shark. She&amp;rsquo;s amazed. I&amp;rsquo;m amazed she&amp;rsquo;s even in the water!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isla-holbox-whaleshark-tour-13.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I cautiously following the tail, scared in case it hits me I bail out. However, the third time I have the greatest pleasure of swimming side by side with one of the earths most magnificent creatures. Its swims gracefully faster than me and slowly slips away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swimming with turtles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the boat heads back in search of land a strange object is spotted in the waters, two turtles are clung together floating on the surface. They are in fact mating, a process which takes an amazing twenty days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isla-holbox-whaleshark-tour-17.jpg" alt="turtles mating"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a kilometre off land the boat anchors and we jump into the sea to snorkel along the coral reef. There&amp;rsquo;s lots fish among the coral, dashing in front and below. Its a good excuse to try out the underwater camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isla-holbox-whaleshark-tour-27.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then all of a sudden a turtle swims underneath us and we follow it, amazed at the colours and patterns on its back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isla-holbox-whaleshark-tour-21.jpg" alt="turtle"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like grabbing it and using it for a free ride, but of course I didn&amp;rsquo;t, &amp;nbsp;this is real life not the Little Mermaid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isla-holbox-whaleshark-tour-26.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boat then heads inland through mangroves into a natural harbour, if the Garden of Eden existed this might be it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isla-holbox-whaleshark-tour-36.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only us, endless sand and turquoise waters and a vast array of wildlife. The shallow waters are full of fish. So many fish they fearlessly swarm&amp;nbsp;around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isla-holbox-whaleshark-tour-35.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge shells can be found in the waters, these are very much alive I can confirm. A huge alien arm came out of one to check out what was happening. Perhaps it tastes nicer than it looks...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isla-holbox-whaleshark-tour-38.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink flamingos stand perched in the distance, undisturbed by our presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isla-holbox-whaleshark-tour-50.jpg" alt="flamingos line"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as the boats head back to harbour we are greeted by dolphins playing beside the boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isla-holbox-whaleshark-tour-44.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A perfect way to top off one of the best days we spent in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Tequila</Title>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;One tequila, two tequila, three tequila, &amp;hellip;floor!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We couldn&amp;rsquo;t go to Mexico without writing a review about its most famous liquor. Tequila is made from the agave plant using the same process as is used for making Mezcal. The only difference is that it has to be made in the region of Tequila to use the name. Similar to Champagne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tequila-review-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By itself the drink is not pleasing. However, add some salt and lime and we have the making of a party. Unlike other drinks which people say are depressive, tequila is said to make you happy. Although there is no scientific proof to back this up I am able to report that I have indeed drank tequila and I am most certainly happy. I&amp;rsquo;m sure that counts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tequila-review-4.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another popular Mexican drink which we have consumed a fair few of is the tequila based cocktail Margarita. Made by mixing tequila with triple sec and lemon juice and adding salt around the rim of the glass, this cocktail is blamed for a few hangovers we have had. Trying to make a similar tasting version I use the strongly lemon flavoured Squirt drink with added limes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Tulum – What the hell happened in Tulum? </Title>
    <TitleURL>mexico/travel/tulum-what-the-hell-happened-in-tulum</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-07-12T16:00:04.377+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;It all started so well. After drinking many beers on the Island of Holbox we arrive in Tulum exhausted. We make an early tea and head to bed. In the morning we are fresh and ready to sightsee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tulum-12.jpg" alt="tulum"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We skip through the ruins, which aren&amp;rsquo;t so impressive but are beautifully situated next to the blue sea and white sand below. Its 30 degrees and rising so we eagerly run down to the beach to have a cool dip in the water but are disappointed to find the beach covered in layers of seaweed. We are also shocked to find the sun loungers are being rented out at 10 pounds a bed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tulum-23.jpg" alt="tulum seaweed"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unable to find shade that doesn&amp;rsquo;t cost a fortune or an area to swim in that isn&amp;rsquo;t clogged with seaweed we head disappointedly back to the hostel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tulum-32.jpg" alt="quintanna roots hostel tulum"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we get back we are informed of a joint birthday party happening the next night for a Argentinian lady who works there and a Columbian guy who has been staying there a while. Despite them saying the party is tomorrow it seems it had already started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tulum-42.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the cocktails flowed and night turned into day and then with little or no sleep another party began, we soon found that our 4 nights at the hostel were up. Reluctant to stay any longer for fear of permanent liver damage we head to the closest A/C hotel we could find and lay there for two days to recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fair to say that we leave Tulum a shadow of our former selves and in much need of a detox.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Laguna Bacalar - The Turquoise Lake</Title>
    <TitleURL>mexico/travel/laguna-bacalar-the-turquoise-lake</TitleURL>

    <Content>&lt;h3&gt;Bacalar &amp;ndash; A bad Start&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it was three days since our crazy party in Tulum I was still feeling fragile. But swayed by the fact Bacalar was only few hours away and the tranquil lagoon looked like heaven we pack our things and move onto our last stop in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/bacalar-3-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately our arrival in Bacalar was not the tranquil experience we had hoped for. Knowing there are only a few low cost options in the area we had booked a hostel online. Getting off the bus on a main road we jump in the nearest taxi to take us there. I was surprised at the cost and the fact he seems to be driving away from the signs for the other hotels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a 10 min drive we are dropped off down a deserted road. I spot a sign for our hostel. We arrive but there are no signs of life apart from a 5 year old by who speaks no English. Blaming ourselves for still not being able to grasp any Spanish we have no idea what to do. The place is beautiful and looks out to the coral green lagoon. But I can only see two cabins which don&amp;rsquo;t give me much hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are starving and there are no signs of anywhere to buy food or water. I suggest we head back to the main road and try to get a taxi back to town. This fails and we end up in the blistering heat getting ate by mosquitos trying to hitch hike a ride back to town. Defeated, we head back to our so called hostel. Thankfully a guy with a car turns up. I try to explain that we can&amp;rsquo;t stay here and our saviour offers to take us to another hostel he owns in town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/bacalar-13-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one he takes us to may not be the luxurious 5 star resort that I had been dreaming of, but it&amp;rsquo;s a lot better than the remote, mosquito infested cabin by the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writing this all in retrospect is fine but at the time I did not handle the situation too well. And it may have ended up with me having a slight breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I have learnt from this experience is that the combination of heat, hunger and mosquitos does not make me a happy person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laguna Bacalar Boat Tour&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite being a haven for mosquitoes Laguana Bacalar is beautiful, we take a boat tour out in to the lake to experience all it has to offer. The first thing that strikes you is the colour, the lake is the lightest form of turquoise and the water is clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/bacalar-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Around the lake there are 3 cenotes, basically a big hole in the ground filled with water. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to spot these as they take on a dark navy blue shade which contrasts with the lighter colours of the shallow waters. We are told the ancient Maya through human sacrifices in the cenotes but that no one has ever been to the bottom to confirm this. Not surprising as the first cenote is a 150m drop to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/bacalar-10.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All along one side of the lake there are hotels ranging from super luxurious to simple hostels. Our hostels not even good enough to be situated anywhere near the waters edge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/bacalar-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we head to the pirates canal, where hundreds of years ago pirates used to wait. The boat is anchored here&amp;nbsp;and we get into the Laguna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/bacalar-16.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leanne tries out the snorkel, returns and realises she can swim, but still maintains that without a snorkel she still can&amp;rsquo;t swim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/bacalar-14.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mud here smells of sulphur, you can rub it in your skin and it&amp;rsquo;s said to have a healing effect. Half an hour of sitting in the mud and we head back to end the trip. Leanne claims to have rejuvenated skin, I claim to smell like an egg!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fort of San Felipe&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our last day in Bacalar is spent swimming in the lake and exploring the fort which overlooks the lagoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/bacalar-6-2.jpg" alt="baclar fort of san felipe"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constructed in the 18th century to defend the citizens from pirates of the Caribbean, the fort now holds a small museum and provides an excellent platform for viewing the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/bacalar-8-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We enjoy what is now our last full day in Mexico getting ourselves prepared for heading south into Central America.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Michelada</Title>
    <TitleURL>mexico/drink-reviews/michelada</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-07-13T00:21:36.43+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Despite seeing Michelada&amp;nbsp;available all over Mexico we did not try this until the very last day. And what&amp;nbsp;better place to try it than the beautiful Laguna Bacalar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We order two and what we receive certainly looks the part. Two glasses, the rims topped with chilli salt, within the glasses there is cool ice and hugging the bottom is a strange brown looking mixture. This is served accompanied by two Coronas to mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/michalada-3.jpg" alt="michelada with corona by lake"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I had no idea what a Michelada contained but common ingredients include, lime juice, teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce and tomato juice. There does not look to be tomato juice and I doubt there&amp;rsquo;s teriyaki sauce. But it&amp;nbsp;does look like there could be Worcestershire or soy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We fill the glass with the beer and give it a swirl with the straw, it certainly looks refreshing in the hot sun. The taste, well it tastes like Mexico in a glass. The sour taste of lime, over the top salt topped off with the familiar taste of chilli. All washed down with a watery beer and ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/michalada-4.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In usual circumstances ice and beer is a tragedy, a bit of lime is okay, maybe chilli, but no way salt, certainly not this amount, it has an uncanny resemblance to sea water. I can&amp;rsquo;t decide whether it is good or bad, perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s a quality in itself. However this strange combination is interesting and I will certainly be finishing the glass.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Mexican Cerveza</Title>
    <TitleURL>mexico/drink-reviews/mexican-cerveza</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-07-14T15:35:17.97+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Cerveza, Spanish for beer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two types of beer in Mexico, Claro (light) and Negra (dark). There is great choice of brands but the variety in taste can be limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have not went out our way to find locally brewed beers, we are just reviewing the beer that is readily available in the local shops, bars and restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sol&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sol translates literally to mean sun and its advertised all over Mexico. Presumably it must be popular but then so is water, in fact other than the light golden colour they taste remarkably similar, although Sol does affect you in different ways. It tastes cool and refreshing when ice cold however when its warm the taste becomes less like water and more like sweaty socks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/mexican-beer-review-1.jpg" alt="sol and tecate light"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sol Limon.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sol with a picture of a lime on the front (or a Lemon in this case, Mexicans say they don&amp;rsquo;t have limes, everything is a lemon, but they definitely look green and lime like to me, even the oranges are green perhaps they call them lemons as well). Don&amp;rsquo;t drink this! It&amp;rsquo;s basically Sol with an awful chemically Lime\Lemon taste added, probably the same as what they add to washing up liquid to make it smell nice. You don&amp;rsquo;t go around drinking Fairy though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tecate Light&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mexico is quite fond of its &amp;ldquo;light&amp;rdquo; beers, I think they are trying to say something about the country&amp;rsquo;s ever expanding average waist line. This one is slightly darker in colour than Sol but has that same taste of water, maybe with a slightly more familiar beer taste. Not so good unless you&amp;rsquo;re on a diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tecate Titanium 5.5%&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mexico&amp;rsquo;s answer to high alcohol beer, bought primarily to get drunk quicker. Perhaps the name &amp;lsquo;Titanium&amp;rsquo; is effecting my judgment but its tasting metallic. If you want to get drunk quick don&amp;rsquo;t buy this go straight into the deep end and buy Mezcal or Tequilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Superior &amp;ndash; Rubia &amp;ndash; 4. 5%&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the name suggests this is a ruby\dark beer, as most beers here are light this makes a change. However, don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled by this, as is common with all Mexican beers this is no ale, there is little if no hoppy taste and quite frankly tastes like water. However when ice cold this makes a refreshing drink. Better than Sol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/mexican-beer-review-3.jpg" alt="indio, dos esquis, superior"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dos Equis &amp;ndash; Lager Especial &amp;ndash; 4.3%&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dos Equis translates to XX, which is pretty accurate as it is similar to XXXX but with half the taste. Tastes watery, not by much it&amp;rsquo;s better than Sol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Modelo Especial.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the more expensive beers, sold as a premium beer and it looks it as well. People can be seen keeping their large bottle of Modelo Especial cool in champagne coolers at some of the fancier restaurants. Tastes very much like Corona which is not surprising as the Modelo group own the Corona brand as well as Victoria and Pacifico to name a few. All in all they own 63% of the Mexican beer market. The beer is not bad for Mexcian beer but I would prefer to drink the much cheaper Corona as I can drink more for less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indio&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes in 1.2 litres bottles and cans of different sizes, this dark beer is actually my favourite. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to drink while not being too watery. Better by far than the rest of the beers in this price range, it actually has a little character to it in comparison to the other beers available. Whilst it retains some of the standard characteristics of Mexican beer I certainly don&amp;rsquo;t want to put a lime in this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/mexican-beer-(3).jpg" alt="modelo beers collection"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Corona Extra &amp;ndash; 4.5%&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world famous Corona, the biggest export of Mexican beer in the world. It&amp;rsquo;s not the most expensive beer in Mexico, in fact corona extra is one of the cheaper options. Although there are a few different options of Corona. This one&amp;rsquo;s not the best but when ice cold you can&amp;rsquo;t go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leon &amp;ndash; 4.5%&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to this one, it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;Cerveza Negra&amp;rdquo; which means dark beer. As most beers here are light and watery perhaps this will be different. The colour is certainly a different shade, like it says on the tin it&amp;rsquo;s definitely darker. The taste however is not. Standard Mexican beer different colour and different packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pacifico &amp;ndash; 4.5%&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a bright yellow can labelled claro cerveza, a lifesaving ring with an anchor in the middle adorns the can, perhaps some reference to the pacific. I feel I already know what&amp;rsquo;s coming. Damn I&amp;rsquo;m right, clear watery and perfect for a hot summers day. The Modelo group appear to have packaged the same beer in several different cans, a clever marketing ploy to fill the shelves but seriously I&amp;rsquo;m not impressed. It&amp;rsquo;s all getting very &amp;lsquo;samey&amp;rsquo;. But ice cold on a hot summers day it hits the spot, I can excuse this since we are in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Final Verdict&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cheapest way to drink beer in Mexcio is to buy the 1.2 litre glass bottles. You pay a 10 peso deposit which you get back when you return the bottle. Depending on where you buy it you can pay anywhere from 30 to 50 pesos for a bottle. At one point we got two for 45 pesos (nearly 2 pound). Smaller bottles and cans generally cost more and these never get recycled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a very different selection of beer in Mexico than in Europe, if you want an imported beer here expect the price to be ridiculously increased. Pretty much all the beers in Mexico are made in Mexico.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion all Mexican beers are pretty much the same, light and really watery which happens to be ideal for the hot weather, when served ice cold I would drink any of them. However my beer of preference would have to be Indio due to its slightly better flavour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Caye Caulker - You better Belize it</Title>
    <TitleURL>belize/travel/caye-caulker-you-better-belize-it</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-07-17T19:37:48.643+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not an easy task getting from Bacalar to Caye Caulker so we get up earlier and set off. And it went something like this, walk to bus station, bus to Chetumal, taxi to New Market Bus Station, bus to Belize City including border crossing, taxi to water boat terminal, boat to Caye Caulker, walk to hotel. All in all it took about seven hours. But it&amp;rsquo;s all worth it when I spot this heavenly sight&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/belize-bus-journey-(6).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;em&gt;No more tacos, limes and chillies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as we hit the Belize border everything feels easier, the official language is English and it&amp;rsquo;s the last English speaking country we will be in for the next 8 months so we are really appreciating the ease of communication. However the quality of the buses and roads has reduced somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/belize-bus-journey-(1).jpg" alt="new market bus station"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Caye Caulker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Off the coast of Belize lies the small island of Caye Caulker. Its laid back Caribbean atmosphere is just what we are looking for. Its small enough to walk the entire island, there&amp;rsquo;s palm trees, it&amp;rsquo;s hot and the sun is shining. We ditch the hostels and take up residence in a nice hotel, although with some bargaining we got the price reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/caye-caulker-streets-(4).jpg" alt="caye caulker"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Eating Lobster&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most famous dish in Belize is the fresh lobster, we are both lobster virgins and it&amp;rsquo;s too good an opportunity to miss. Caye Caulker is probably one of the cheapest places on earth to eat lobster and we have arrived in the middle of lobster season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/caye-caulker-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For about $10 we get a fresh whole lobster with&amp;nbsp;sides, 3 rum punches and cake for afterwards. We have no idea how to eat the creature brought to us, but give it our best shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/caye-caulker-11.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tastes delicious, how the lobster felt during the whole process we will never know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Snorkelling the Barrier Reef and Shark Ray Alley&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running along the Belize coast is the meso-american barrier reef, the second largest in the world. You can see the reef about 1 mile off the coast of Caye Caulker, identifiable&amp;nbsp;by mid ocean waves breaking as they hit the reef. Being so&amp;nbsp;close we have no choice but to take a boat and snorkelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/caye-caulker-22.jpg" alt="snorkelling caye caulker"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We snorkel the reef but it&amp;rsquo;s too deep to take the camera. We don&amp;rsquo;t intend on losing it. The coral is dotted with lots of multi coloured fish and our guide takes us around pointing our various different species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/caye-caulker-48.jpg" alt="snorkelling shark ray alley"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlight of the trip is the stop off at Shark Ray Alley where we get to swim with nurse sharks and sting rays. These gentle creatures dance around us as we snorkel trying to capture a shot of them in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/caye-caulker-45.jpg" alt="two nurse sharks"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/caye-caulker-23.jpg" alt="sting rays"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We end the day slightly more sunburnt than we would have liked. But we can&amp;rsquo;t complain too much, we have another evening of drinking rum and watching the sunset to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/caye-caulker-4.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total we ended up spending 5 nights in Caye Caulker and we could have easily stayed more. There isn&amp;rsquo;t a lot to do which was perfect for us after over 2 months of travelling. We both really appreciated a stay in a nice hotel with a pool where we could recharge our batteries for our next stop, the action packed town of San Ignacio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not an easy task getting from Bacalar to Caye Caulker so we get up earlier and set off. And it went something like this, walk to bus station, bus to Chetumal, taxi to New Market Bus Station, bus to Belize City including border crossing, taxi to water boat terminal, boat to Caye Caulker, walk to hotel. All in all it took about seven hours. But it&amp;rsquo;s all worth it when I spot this...</ContentPreview>

    <Title>San Ignacio - Caves, Water and Darkness </Title>

    <Content>&lt;h3&gt;San Ignacio&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Located close to the Guatemalan border this small town houses tourists looking to do more adventurous trips to the numerous caves, ruins and jungles which surround the area. After 5 days relaxing we are ready and willing to embrace some action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/atm-adventure-1.jpg" alt="atm adventure"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our first challenge is to find some accommodation. Belize is not cheap and we had splurged in Caye Caulker on a nice hotel so we were on the lookout for a budget option. After looking at a few guesthouses we settled for a room at The Plaza. This is not to be confused with the fancy up market hotel bearing the same name. This place is owned by an old Spanish couple and the rooms are part of their home. The woman is nice, although she does feel the need to give me a 10 minute tutorial in how to lock the gate, ending with me having to demonstrate to her that I am capable of locking it. Once she is satisfied she gives us the keys. The room is basic and a bit tired looking but its only &amp;pound;13 a night and it seems ok. That is until the clock strikes 11pm. As we are tucking ourselves into bed, knackered after a day of travelling we hear the sound of BOOM BOOM. I was certain I didn&amp;rsquo;t see a club next door but clearly I was mistaken as the bass vibrates around our room. Great. We have just booked ourselves in for 4 sleepless nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next night, after a few drinks, we decide if you can&amp;rsquo;t beat them you may as well join them. So off we head in search for this club which turns out to be in the street behind our guesthouse. We walk into San Ignacios answer to Bee Jay&amp;rsquo;s (A &amp;ldquo;club&amp;rdquo; in our hometown). I have never seen so many speakers! The club has a handful of people in and none of them are dancing. I ask if the club is open every night, &amp;ldquo;7 days a week&amp;rdquo; the manager tells me. &amp;ldquo;Fantastic&amp;rdquo; I say, as I order more rum. Thankfully the alcohol does the trick and we both pass out when we get back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-igancio-club-1.jpg" alt="san ignacio club"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ATM (Actun Tunichil Muknal) Caves&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the more popular adventure tours is to visit the ATM caves. Discovered in 1986 these caves, which contain Mayan artefacts and skeletal remains, have only been open to the public since 1998. The tours itself requires a reasonably good level of fitness. Beginning with a 45min hike through the jungle crossing rivers you reach the entrance to the cave. To enter you plunge into the cold water and then begin to swim, walk, crawl and scramble through the rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/atm-cave-in-belize-(1).jpg" alt="atm cave entrance"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour is not ideal if you have a fear of the dark, heights, water or confined spaces. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of any of those things but it&amp;rsquo;s worth facing the fears as the sights inside the cave are breath taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/atm_cave_swim.jpeg" alt="atm cave swim"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formations of the stalactites and stalagmites look like works of art. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see why the Mayans thought this was the entrance to the underworld. Our guide tells us that they would take hallucinogenic drugs before entering with only a torch to light the way. I can only imagine the things that they would have seen as even without the aid of drugs the formations cast eerie shadows across the walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/atm-pots.jpg" alt="atm pots"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we reach the larger chambers we see artefacts left by Mayans who performed religious ceremonies here. The grand finally is the perfectly preserved full skeletal remains of one of the human sacrifices. This place could be quite frightening if there wasn&amp;rsquo;t several other tour group queuing behind us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/skeleton-atm-cave.jpg" alt="atm cave sacrafice"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately you aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to take a camera into the caves. This was stopped when a tourist, too eager to catch the perfect shot, dropped his Sony camera onto one of the priceless ancient skulls. Probably wasn&amp;rsquo;t one of his better days! We have stolen a few photos from the internet so you can get an idea of what you can see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/atm-belize-main-room.jpg" alt="atm main room"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way out we are neck deep in water (full submerged for some of us!) and we are forced to squeeze through narrow passages. Its touch and go whether Karl could get his head though some of the gaps but luckily he makes it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/atm-tight-squeeze.jpg" alt="atm tight squeeze"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour was fantastic, our guide was Carlos the Caveman and he did an excellent job of getting us though the cave safely as well as being extremely enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the history of the cave. Although the trip was expensive (US$85 PP) it is a must do when in Belize and we would highly recommended Carlos if you are planning on visiting the ATM as there are a number of different tour operators to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cahal Pech&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our second day was a lot more relaxing. We went on a short walk to find the local ruins of Cahal Pech. Cahal Pech was a city from 900BC to 800AD. Although not as impressive as some of the other ruins we have visited it did have a well preserved home of one of the rich families of the town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/cahal-pech-9.jpg" alt="cahal pech house"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We spend the afternoon in San Ignacio. The town itself was established by the British for the production of Mahogany and was later used as a military training base. On our tours out of town we pass villages called Never Delay, Duck Run and my particular favourite, Tea Kettle. The British clearly had a laugh when they were here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/teakettle-sign.jpg" alt="teakettle church sign"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cave Tubing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our last day in Belize was spent exploring another set of caves. However, unlike the action packed ATM, this time we were given a rubber tube (tractor tyre inner tube) to float down the river in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/belize-cave-tubing-3.jpg" alt="cave tubing belize"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully the river wasn&amp;rsquo;t flowing too fast as it took a while to master the use of hands as ores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/belize-cave-tubing-17.jpg" alt="cave tubing belize"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once we had mastered the skill of cave tubing we could put our feet up and enjoy the view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/belize-cave-tubing-13.jpg" alt="cave tubing belize"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had a stop off to do some cave jumping. Although it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too high jumping into the crystal clear waters where you can see the rocks below made it a tad more exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/belize-cave-tubing-22.jpg" alt="belize cave tubing river"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our last day, as with most days in Belize, was finished off with a rum punch. Feeling good after getting the adrenaline pumping in San Ignacio we set off into Guatemala ready to see what adventure awaits us there.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Belizean Rum</Title>
    <TitleURL>belize/drink-reviews/belizean-rum</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-07-23T19:37:57.993+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Belize&amp;rsquo;s cultural past and coastal location means that it feels more like the Caribbean than its more Latino neighbours. It is because of this link that the national drink of Belize is the hardcore liquor rum. &lt;br /&gt;Sold everywhere there is a range of brands available. From the super cheap Travellers Rum to the more upmarket oaked aged varieties there is plenty of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/belize-rum-menu.jpg" alt="belize rum menu"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most popular mix for this spirit, which is made using sugar cane, is coke. Or for a fruitier option many bars offer a rum punch which seems to be rum mixed with whatever fruit juice they can find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/caye-caulker-sunset-6.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rum is one of my least favourite spirits and mixed with coke somehow makes it taste even worse. It is just bearable in a fruit punch. If you have the same dislike for the taste as myself there are a number of coconut flavoured rums available, blended with coconut after distillation this can be mixed with pineapple juice to make a much more pleasing drink that fits perfectly with the slow paced Caribbean lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/caye-caulker-sunset-4.jpg" alt="kuknat rum"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few bottles we are almost ready to don a spyglass, grab a large black hat and head out in search for a ship to charter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Belikin Beer</Title>
    <TitleURL>belize/drink-reviews/belikin-beer</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-07-24T03:15:50+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;h3&gt;Belikin Beer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belikin beer is a staple of the national diet in Belize, you can&amp;rsquo;t travel through Belize and miss it. It is advertised on every street corner, sold in every shop, and drank in every bar and restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/belikin-2.jpg" alt="belikin beer bucket"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Mexico&amp;rsquo;s rather light and watery attempt at beer surely Belikin will be different, after all the British were here and have influenced many things in this region. The first taste of Belikin was on Caye Caulker and experienced the local way. That is go to the shop, open the bottle with the bottle opener attached to the service desk and coolly drink while walking along the street. However on further inspection it looks like this is all some of the locals do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t blame them, Belikin is a fantastic tasting beer. It&amp;rsquo;s not watery and has a strong flavour, after Mexico&amp;rsquo;s beer failures this stuff is like heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Belikin Stout&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Belikin also comes in a stout version which is 6.5% and is my preferred choice and probably that of the local alcoholics too. The English influence is clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beer cost 3 Belize dollars which is about &amp;pound;1 which sounds good until you realise the bottles are only 284ml. Another valid reason to prefer the stout. But there is a very good reason for smaller bottles, the temperature in Belize is so hot that your beer will turn warm very quickly. The small bottle means you can drink up&amp;nbsp;before it goes warm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After speaking with one of the local distributors of Belkin I am now informed that the Belize Brewing Company is looking to expand its business outside of Belize, so watch out for this fantastic Belizean beer in a town near you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Guinness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although not actually Belizean this version of Guinness is very different from the drink found in the UK. For a start its 7.5% and goes straight to your head. There&amp;rsquo;s no pint of Guinness here only a small glass bottle of strong stout. It works well for me another top beer in Belize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/belize-guiness-bottle.jpg" alt="belize guiness"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lighthouse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beer market in Belize is pretty limited. There&amp;rsquo;s Belikin beer, Belikin stout and Guinness. However Lighthouse beer shows up in a few bars and restaurants. It turns out its also brewed by the Belize Brewing Company, the same company that brews Belikin and bottles Guinness, I&amp;rsquo;m put off by the fact the beer is 4.2% and only 237ml. That&amp;rsquo;s roughly the same capacity of my mouth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/lighthouse-lager-1.jpg" alt="lighthouse lager and nachos"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t think I seen anyone drinking this except Leanne who tried it once and she appeared very opinionated, &amp;ldquo;It just tastes like beer&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>El Mirador Day 1 - Into the Jungle</Title>
    <TitleURL>guatemala/el-mirador/el-mirador-day-1-into-the-jungle</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-07-29T16:50:53.557+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leanne Says:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had been in Guatemala for less than two hours and we had already signed ourselves up for one of the country&amp;rsquo;s most challenging treks. I had done very limited research, which was probably for the best, and had been sold a seemingly too-good- to-turn-down deal of US$200pp (we had seen it advertised for around US$350pp elsewhere).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day of the trek began with an early start. We were collected from our hotel at 6am and began the journey with a two hour bus journey on one of the worst roads I have ever seen&amp;hellip; or felt! We arrived at the village of Carmelita feeling sick. This was to be the last village we would see over the next few days as ahead of us lay jungle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day1-2.jpg" alt="carmelita"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Carmelita we had breakfast and were introduced to our group. There were seven of us altogether. Made up of an eclectic mix of american mormons, tattooed bikers, a well-travelled linguist and two Geordies. It soon became apparent over our discussions that not everyone had paid the same for the trip. Which was not a good start for those who had paid almost double than us. It seems that if you are the person, or people, to start the trip you pay a premium and if you tag along later you get the trip much cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day1-17.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something fishy was definitely going on as the guide split our group of seven into two. So off went all the Spanish speaking people in one group, leaving us English speaking people with our Spanish speaking guide. As he began explaining the trip to us we looked at each other in horror. This was going to be fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We didn&amp;rsquo;t begin walking until 10.30am by which point the sun was heating up nicely. The first part of the walk was down a dirt road with not much foliage for shade. This meant only one thing. Sweat, sweat and more sweat! The heat and humidity was almost unbearable. Our two companions also seemed to be suffering in the heat however the polish guy, called Moscow, had his own method of coping in the form of a bottle of vodka which hung from a hip flask from his belt. As they passed the bottle around at 11am we immediately knew these were the type of people we could get along well with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day1-5.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time we reached our lunch point we had caught up with the other group and asked our guides if we could all stick together. At least now we would be able to understand what the hell we were doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day1-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We walked for another two hours before reaching our camp. During this time I realised that any sort of system to manage the sweat would fail. All my clothes were drenched and I could already begin to smell myself. I had also found out that another discrepancy between our bookings is that the other people had been told they could put a bag on the mule. We were told we had to carry all our stuff in our day bags meaning we had packed light. As people collected their huge bags at the camp I began to think that we may have come slightly underprepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our first night was spent at a fairly well set up camp located next to the ancient Mayan site El Tintal. From the map we were shown the sight looked huge. However, we were slightly disappointed to find that we could only see the top of one of the temples as all the rest has been consumed by the jungle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tintal-stairs-1.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We climbed to the top of the temple for sunset and got our first gimps of the never ending dense jungle that surrounded us. It was fair to say that we were well and truly in the wild now and there was no turning back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day1-18.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The early start and first days walk took their toll and we were ready to climb into our tents as soon as the sun went down. Day one over, only four more to go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karl Says:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crazy two and half hour bus ride across dirt tracks already had my insides rattled and my head spinning before we even arrived at the village of Carmelita. We passed through two military check points, ranches and remote villages on the way to the edge of civilisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day1-1.jpg" alt="carmelita"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out the guide only speaks Spanish which I don&amp;rsquo;t mind as I can practice Spanish, Leanne however is not so positive. As we set off on the 5 day trek I realise I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything with me, one spare t-shirt, one spare pair of pants, two pairs of socks, a tooth brush and a bottle of water. But what do you really need in the jungle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day1-6.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The days walking is awful my body has become lazy with all the travelling, I don&amp;rsquo;t feel fit at all and throughout the entire 32km walk my back is in pain and my hip injury has made a return. Its 35C and I&amp;rsquo;m sweating profusely and dreaming of a cold diet coke. The sweat has caused a serious case of chafing and hobbling like a penguin feels like a good idea. I won&amp;rsquo;t be wearing any boxer shorts for the rest of this trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is really nothing at all to see, well perhaps there was but I didn&amp;rsquo;t care I just wanted to get the first day over. It felt like walking the wrong way up one long endless jungle escalator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day1-20.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We camped at the ancient city of El Tintal, the camp was basic but better than what I imagined. The best thing of the day was watching the sunset from the top of an ancient temple. Although mostly reclaimed by the jungle its top manages to burst through the tree canopy giving views of endless jungle in all directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day1-15.jpg" alt="el tigre panarama"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leanne Says:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had been in Guatemala for less than two hours and we had already signed ourselves up for one of the country&amp;rsquo;s most challenging treks. I had done very limited research, which was probably for the best, and had been sold a seemingly too-good- to-turn-down deal of US$200pp (we had seen it advertised for around US$350pp elsewhere).&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>El Mirador Day 2 - Following the Mayan Trail</Title>
    <TitleURL>guatemala/el-mirador/el-mirador-day-2-following-the-mayan-trail</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-07-29T16:52:56.223+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leanne Says:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We woke at sunrise after a surprisingly pleasant night&amp;rsquo;s sleep. Stepping out of the tent we saw spider monkeys climbing on the trees above us. Watching their amazing acrobatics was a great start to the day.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-monkey-1.jpg" alt="spider monkey in tree"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After breakfast we heard a few shouts from where they prepared the food. It turned out to be a scorpion wondering around the camp. I was becoming more and more aware that the jungle was teeming with wildlife, most of which could kill you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day2-2.jpg" alt="scorpion"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day two&amp;rsquo;s trek was longer than the first. The jungle had become denser which meant that we were in the shade more. However a new challenge had presented itself in the form of blisters which were popping up all over my feet. My inadequate walking shoes and wet socks were causing serious problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a hard days trek we made it to El Mirador. The camp was more rustic than the first but we were all happy to have made it that far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day2-43.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the afternoon I had to beg borrow and steal some plasters, pins and iodine to try and doctor my feet. We do own a first aid kit designed specifically for trekking but had failed to actually pack it on the trek. I was thankful that we didn&amp;rsquo;t have to do much walking the next day as we were to spend the day exploring the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At dusk we climbed to the top of another temple and watched a perfect sunset over the jungle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day2-38.jpg" alt="sunset at el mirador"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Our tent for that evening was worse than the first night and I was becoming increasingly worried about a hole in the tent as we passed poisonous snakes and cockroaches on steroids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-snake.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were shrieks in the night from another camp as a girl claimed to have seen a scorpion in her tent. As I lay there on the hard floor of the tent, blistered feet, smelling worse than a sewer with deadly animals circling the tent I seriously questioned what we were doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karl Says:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day starts early, there&amp;rsquo;s monkeys in trees above our tent and there&amp;rsquo;s a commotion about a scorpion in the camp. Do I want to walk 35km through the jungle, well not really. I usually like walking but it&amp;rsquo;s just so hot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day2-walk-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This&amp;nbsp;day however is more interesting, the jungle is thicker and there&amp;rsquo;s wildlife all around. We pass an old gatehouse and several crumbling ruins. At one the guide goes inside, presumably a tomb and comes out with a pre-classic Mayan plate that would be more suited to a museum than a jungle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day2-4.jpg" alt="mayan plate at el-mirador"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path we are following is thousands of years old and follows the ancient Mayan road system which is why there are ruins dotted&amp;nbsp;along the side. This road has also been used by drug smugglers on the way to Mexico and also by looters who search the ancient sites for artefacts to sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wildlife here is better, I spot a poisonous green snake with a blue head, several frogs and lizards, wild turkey and other birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day2-21.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way the guide stops at a tree with a black looking bark, almost as if it&amp;rsquo;s diseased. He says this tree is incredibly poisonous and never to touch it. He then recalls the story of a boy in the village who tryed to chop the same species of tree with a machete and died. His airways closed and he died of suffocation. Two minutes later he showed us the tree\bush that was the antidote, presumably the boy was unable to find the cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hobbling like a penguin I arrive at El-Mirador, well it&amp;rsquo;s the sign to El-Mirador national park. I&amp;rsquo;m disappointed to learn that the camp is still another 30 minutes away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day2-12.jpg" alt="el-mirador sign"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Behind the sign is the sight of El Muerte where two ancient tombs sit amongst the trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day2-15.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We crawl inside on hands and knees with a head lamp for light, around small tunnels barely big enough to squeeze through, only to be greeted by a load of bats hanging from the roof and flying past our heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day2-16.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evening is spent at the top of El-Tigre the tallest Mayan temple where we watch the sunset across the jungle canopy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day2-39.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The camp for the night is uncomfortable, mainly because I&amp;rsquo;m lying on a concrete floor. The battered sponge mattress is a waste of time. Leanne seams more worried about insects. I go to sleep covered in sweat, without a shower and in the same clothes for two days.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leanne Says:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We woke at sunrise after a surprisingly pleasant night&amp;rsquo;s sleep. Stepping out of the tent we saw spider monkeys climbing on the trees above us. Watching their amazing acrobatics was a great start to the day.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>El Mirador Day 3 - Wandering the ancient city</Title>

    <DateCreated>2015-07-29T16:56:34.317+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leanne Says:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On day three we were awoken to the sound of howler monkeys roaring as these small creatures take on the sound of a powerful lion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite a restless night I was ready and willing to take on the jungle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day3-34.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We spent the day hobbling around this impressive Mayan site. First discovered in 1926 this huge complex of buildings remain largely hidden in the jungle. It has not received the same funding from the Guatemalan government as the more famous Tikal. What work has been carried out has been privately funded. Some of the money being donated by the actor Mel Gibson who shot the film Apocolypto using this location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-mel--gibson-sign.jpg" alt="mel gibson sign el mirador"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only one archaeologist who works on the site with up to 200 workers. We had arrived the day before they were due to commence their next dig so had the place to ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Mirador was a lot different to what we had seen before on the more developed and restored sites in Mexico and it was interesting to see how the site would have looked when it was first discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot still unknown about the Mayans and the small bits they have excavated are constantly providing more and more clues into the workings of this mysterious civilisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The centrepiece is the huge Pyramid de la Danta. At 70m high this is the largest to be found in Mesoamerica. I block out the pain in my feet to enjoy climbing around this impressive structure and take in the surreal environment we have placed ourselves in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day3-27.jpg" alt="climbing la danta"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another highlight of the day was the &amp;lsquo;shower&amp;rsquo; which we found on the workers campground. For less than &amp;pound;1 we were given a bucket of water which poured into an actual shower head. Finally we could make some attempt at cleaning ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day3-52.jpg" alt="el mirador shower"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refreshing feeling did not last long, as soon as we stepped out the water the humidity caused sweat to reappear and what clean clothes we had left did not say clean for long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karl Says:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We wake at first light to what sounds like a zombie apocalypse. This frightful sound is in fact a group of howler monkeys who are well deserving of their name. The day starts with breakfast provided by the cooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day3-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After watching the sunset from the&amp;nbsp;tallest temple El Tigre last night, today the first thing we do is head to La Danta. Not quite as tall this temple is one of the biggest ancient structures ever built. In total mass it&amp;rsquo;s the biggest pyramid in the world. Comprising of 3 layered platforms, the bottom layer being the size of 18 football fields. Its hard grasp the size of it as the bottom layer is still covered in jungle. However several excavations have revealed the stairs leading to the first platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walk for a while and then move on up to the second layer which is made easier by make shift stairs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day3-11.jpg" alt="el mirador stairs"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then through the trees we see the top section, which in itself is quite a size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day3-31.jpg" alt="la dante el mirador"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jungle has not quite taken over the top of&amp;nbsp;the temple but it has certainly tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day3-20.jpg" alt="la dante"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course we have to climb it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-el-dante-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon we visit several others sites and I climb another pyramid. Alone this time. Perhaps the most impressive of the other structures is what is thought to be a swimming pool attached to a royal palace, archaeologists have uncovered the perfectly preserved image of a swimming man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day3-41.jpg" alt="el mirador swimming man"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Mirador is an impressive place, to see the effects of time on a 2000 year old city is stunning. Thinking about what is left to be uncovered makes me want to get a trowel and wide brimmed hat and start digging. I would love to come back here in 30 years&amp;rsquo; time and see how the site has progressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening we have quite possibly the best shower ever. Even though it&amp;rsquo;s constructed of four posts with a piece of thin plastic wrapped around the watering can\shower is like heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day3-51.jpg" alt="bucket shower"  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leanne Says:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Workers and mules began to stream in as we prepared to leave camp. We even managed to catch a glimpse of the infamous Dr Henson who is leading the dig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-workers.jpg" alt="el mirador workers"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As this was not a circular trek days three and four were spent retracing our steps back to Carmalita. We knew how long the second day had been so we were all in the frame of mind to get it over with as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By focusing on anything but the pain in my feet I managed to make it back to the camp in record time giving us the afternoon to spend watching the wildlife from the comfort of a hammock&amp;hellip; well as comfortable you can be with tarantulas walking around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day45-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On our final day we were all in good spirits and allowed ourselves to indulge in the thoughts of the luxuries which would await us back in civilisation. Things such as refrigeration, air con, showers and comfortable beds were suddenly things that we no longer took for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The walk was still hard and just as my feet were about to give up on me we heard the heavenly sound of a truck coming down the dirt road. We were only 30 minutes from the village but the truck looked so appealing. All but two of us jumped in with little or no hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day45-3.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in Carmalita we were ushered into the local bar (which also doubled as someone&amp;rsquo;s living room) and were handed a cold beer to celebrate. I had spent many hours imagining this cold beer so the moment was sincerely enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day45-12.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had a celebratory meal with the group and basked in our own achievement for a few hours before departing back to Flores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day45-10.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The experience was both amazing and challenging. I was grateful that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t made much worse as we were trekking in the wet season the path could have been a muddy swamp filled with mosquitos. Luckily it had been unusually dry so the ground was hard and there were few mosquitos. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how well I would have coped if it had been like that, but then again, the trip was hard enough as it was. However, the struggle was worth it to see this unique part of the world and we were privileged to witness first-hand the beautiful wildlife and scenery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day45-11.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Placing ourselves well and truly outside of our comfort zone made me surprised with what we can actual cope with. It also gave me a renewed appreciation for the comforts we get used to in our everyday lives&amp;hellip;.. Especially Air Con&amp;hellip;I now have a great appreciation for Air Con!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karl Says:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing left to do now but walk back with two days ahead it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a long journey. There&amp;rsquo;s no other way back unless you take a very expensive helicopter ride. The first two days walking has kick started my body back into fitness, the walking today is much easier. As we made it back into the night&amp;rsquo;s camp I felt as if I could continue walking all the way out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day45-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leanne and I spent the afternoon lying in hammocks, butterflies danced around Leanne while wasps encircled me. Monkeys passed through the trees above dropping things beside us as they went as vultures sneaked past and waited in nearby trees. Did we really look that close to death?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final day flew over and the final stretch was cut short by taking a lift in the back of a truck straight to Carmelita for celebratory beers and a fantastic chicken and rice dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day45-6.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-mirador-day45-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mini bus took us back to Flores where we had a room reserved in the Ramada with&amp;nbsp;all the comforts of modern life awaiting us. A bed, a shower and place to recover from this unforgettable experience.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Tikal and Flores - Visiting the greatest ancient Mayan city</Title>
    <TitleURL>guatemala/world-history/tikal-and-flores-visiting-the-greatest-ancient-mayan-city</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-08-02T01:00:47.207+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;h3&gt;Flores&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We cross the border from Belize and make our way to Flores, Guatemala. This is going to be our base for the next 10 days. Our&amp;nbsp;plan is to first trek through the jungle to the ancient city of &lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/category/el-mirador/http://intrepidnomads.com/category/el-mirador/" target="_blank"&gt;El-Mirador&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and then on our return take a day trip to Tikal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/flores-birdseye.jpg" alt="flores birdseye view"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flores itself is built in the middle of the lake Lago Pet&amp;eacute;n Itz&amp;aacute; and was the last stronghold of the Maya, it being the last place to fall to the Spanish. Nowadays it&amp;rsquo;s a tourist hotspot with most visitors heading to nearby Tikal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/flores-5.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tikal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the mini buses enters the Tikal national park the tour guide stands at the front and won&amp;rsquo;t shut up, his enthusiasm knows no bounds. We didn&amp;rsquo;t pay for a tour guide but it appears we have one anyway. While the rest of the passengers listen intently we sneak off down the lonely jungle path towards temple 4 on the way we pass the national tree of Guatamala the ceiba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tikal-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tikal is set amongst dense jungle with huge ancient temples and an abundance of wildlife. It is often regarded as the greatest of all Maya sites and we have deliberately saved this site for last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tikal-19.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We make our way to the Great Plaza through the shaded jungle path, birds and insects fill the air with sound and all around ancient buildings lie crumbled and lifeless, swallowed by jungle many years ago. There is clearance in the trees&amp;nbsp;and we are welcomed by the site of a huge temple standing upright and reaching for the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tikal-4.jpg" alt="tikal temple 1 rear view"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we walk around the corner the sight is spectacular. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see why this is thought of as the greatest Mayan site, the Grand Plaza is monumental in size, surrounded by temples and ancient structures this really feels like the heart of an ancient world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tikal-31.jpg" alt="tikal grand plaza"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temple we saw first is Temple 1 also known as The Temple Of the Great Jaguar, this is actually a tomb for the great king Jasaw Chan K'awil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tikal-8.jpg" alt="tikal temple of the jaguar"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the north of the plaza is the North Acropolis complex, this was the final resting place of numerous Mayan rulers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tikal-10.jpg" alt="tikal gran plaza"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temple 2 also known as the Temple of the Mask faces Temple 1 directly at the opposite&amp;nbsp;side of the plaza, there is a stair case that allows you to climb it for good views of the plaza complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tikal-7.jpg" alt="tikal temple 2"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the south of the plaza is the Central Acropolis a great palatial building that was amazing to walk and climb around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tikal-34.jpg" alt="tikal central accropolis"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We visited several other sites including the grand&amp;nbsp;pyramid, the oldest building on the site, dating from 300bc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tikal-16.jpg" alt="tikal grand pyramid"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temple 5 is well excavated and huge and we were&amp;nbsp;the only ones there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tikal-15.jpg" alt="temple 5 tikal"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 1000&amp;rsquo;s of building at Tikal many we did not have time to visit and many more which are only now beginning to be excavated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final site of note is the tallest structure on the site and known as temple 5. The top is a perfect place to witness fantastic views of the temples and pyramids poking through the jungle canopy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tikal-18.jpg" alt="tikal treetops"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During our time here we spotted several bird species, spider monkeys, howler monkeys, a tarantula, a wild fox and a strange raccoon like animal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tikal-23.jpg" alt="tikal animal"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tikal is definitely the best Mayan site we have visited and we have seen a lot over the past 2 months, its remote location in Guatemala means it does not have the huge crowds of tourists like those of Mexico&amp;rsquo;s Yucatan peninsula, the jungle surroundings are fantastic and magical, the buildings are by far the best we have seen so far and the size of the site is monumental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the best ancient sites in the world!&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;h3&gt;Flores&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We cross the border from Belize and make our way to Flores, Guatemala. This is going to be our base for the next 10 days.

    <Title>Rio Dulce and Livingston - Guatemala Caribbean Style</Title>
    <TitleURL>guatemala/travel/rio-dulce-and-livingston-guatemala-caribbean-style</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-08-08T21:26:12.54+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;We get off the bus but the town of Rio Dulce its self is not so nice, typical of any Guatemalan high street it&amp;rsquo;s chaotic, busy and dusty. We head straight for the boat terminal and find a boat to take us to one of the many hotels along the side of the lake. The boat speeds&amp;nbsp;across the lake and through mangroves before we arrive at the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/rio-dulce-39.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hotel we arrive at is raised on stilts and there is water all around. You can see turtles and fish in the water beneath. Although it&amp;rsquo;s set in mangroves it still feels like it&amp;rsquo;s in the lake. Our cabin does not look much from the outside but inside it&amp;rsquo;s really nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/rio-dulce-36.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rio Dulce is a haven for yachts coming from the Caribbean, all along its shores there is expensive yachts and sailing boats moored. According to the US government this is supposed to be the safest place in the Caribbean to leave your boat during hurricane season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/rio-dulce-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boat Ride to Livingston&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason we are here is to take a boat trip down the Rio Dulce which in English translates to &amp;lsquo;Sweet River&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/rio-dulce-19.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing we pass is the Castillo de San Felipe, built buy the Spanish in the 16th century to stop pirates entering the Lake Izabal which is connected to the Caribbean Sea via the Rio Dulce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/rio-dulce-3.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We stop off at hot springs and drive slowly passing birds nesting in the mangroves. All along the way the river is dotted with thatched houses and gorgeous green trees and we pass fisherman casting their nets by hand from canoes made from hollowed out tree trunks. At one point the local children paddle their canoes close to try and sell us souvenirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/rio-dulce-13.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we get closer to the sea there is fantastic views as the river twists and turns through a canyon lined by tropical trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/rio-dulce-24.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Livingston&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Livingston being on he Caribbean Sea is very different to the rest of Guatemala, it has a Caribbean vibe more like Belize than Spanish speaking Guatemala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/rio-dulce-30.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its populated with a mix of Mayan\Spanish peoples and Garifuna many of which being the descendants of ship wrecked slave&amp;rsquo;s from the Honduran island of Roatan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I however like to affectionately call them Rasta men due to the fact that within 10 seconds of arriving they are trying to sell us weed. There&amp;rsquo;s Bob Marley and gangster rap being played far too loud in the restaurants and shops which adds to the laid back vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no real need to stay here and the 3 hours we have is enough to grab some food and get my hair cut for 10 Qetzals. That&amp;rsquo;s roughly 80p and probably the cheapest hair cut I have ever had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tasty looking pig was spotted going for an afternoon stroll down the high street but got away quickly when it realised I was thinking about Bacon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/rio-dulce-32.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boat ride back was relaxing with fewer stops. Back at the hotel the rest of our time was spent enjoying the lake, relaxing in the sun and playing around in canoes and rowing boats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/rio-dulce-45.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having had a relaxing time in Rio Dulce we took&amp;nbsp;the bus from the Sundog Caf&amp;eacute; and headed into central Guatemala to the small village of Lanquin.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;We get off the bus but the town of Rio Dulce its self is not so nice, typical of any Guatemalan high street it&amp;rsquo;s chaotic, busy and dusty.

    <Title>Semuc Champey - Beautiful Pools and Dark Caves </Title>
    <TitleURL>guatemala/travel/semuc-champey-beautiful-pools-and-dark-caves</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-08-08T21:30:29.137+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Semuc Champey is not an easy place to get to. From Rio Dulce it&amp;rsquo;s a five hour bus journey through the mountains on mainly unpaved roads. From Antigua it&amp;rsquo;s an 8hr journey but on better roads. So what is it that entices travellers to this remote part of Guatemala? Well the answer is that it is a place of outstanding natural beauty. Photographs will never be able to do this place justice you simply have to see it for yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/semuc-champey-5.jpg" alt="semuc champey road"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact seeing it is not the best part. The series of overflowing waterfalls are better experienced by climbing, swimming sliding and falling through the turquoise pools in this natural waterpark for adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/semuc-champey-50.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our trip to Semuc Champey began by arriving in Lanquin, a nearby town with a few hostels. We arrived in the afternoon and chose the Hostel El Retiro to stay. This was probably our biggest mistake as although the hostel is beautifully laid out beside the river the staff have no idea what is going on and they ended up double booking our room (this happens a lot in Guatemala) and then moving us to another room in a different hotel across the road which was still in the process of being built. Despite this the alternative room did have air con and the food in the restaurant was delicious so not all was bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We booked the tour to Semuc Champey through the hostel as they offered one night free if you book through them. The cost of the trip was Q180pp. You can get this cheaper if you look elsewhere in town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did not know much about what the trip entailed when we signed up. Once again this was probably a good thing as I may not have went on the trip if I had known in advance the dangers I was about to face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day began at 9am, our group was ridiculously huge and they carted us up like sheep into the back of two trucks. Literally like sheep. This turned out to be an excellent way to enjoy the 40min ride as you can fully appreciate the stunning views of the surrounding countryside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/semuc-champey-1.jpg" alt="semuc champey truck"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first activity of the day was tubing. Seemingly where ever there is a river in Central America you must throw yourself down it in a rubber tyre. This was great fun, made even more hilarious by the fact that Karl&amp;rsquo;s tyre was deflating and couldn&amp;rsquo;t hold him up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/semuc-champey-19.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as the rest of the group floated gently down the river Karl was left behind trying to swim the tyre along. As we got out we were asked if we would like to jump off a bridge into the river. After watching a few brave souls, we politely declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/semuc-champey-12.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next we were told we were going to explore some caves. We had done the ATM in Belize so I was feeling a bit of a pro. However, unlike Belize where we had been given helmets and head touches on this tour we were given a candle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/semuc-champey-26.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I was thinking the cave must be easy enough to explore as we must be able to walk with the candle. NO. I WAS WRONG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/semuc-champey-30.jpg" alt="semuc champey caves down ladders"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plunging into deep pools of water in the pitch black the guides expected us to swim using one hand while holding the candle in the air, then climb over rocks and up ladders or ropes&amp;hellip; all while holding a candle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/semuc-champey-29.jpg" alt="semuc champey caves candle"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My candle caused more problems than it solved. As did the flip flops I had chosen to wear which were of no use whatsoever. I also have a fear of deep water so being unable to judge when we were about to plunge into another deep pool was a bit frightening, to say the least. Luckily Karl reluctantly helped me as I offloaded the candle and flip-flops onto him so I was able to franticly grasp into the darkness for something to hold onto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/semuc-champey-28.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the cave the guides made us jump down a narrow gap which had water flowing down and dive into the pitch black. They tell you to keep your unprotected head slightly to the left in case you hit a rock. I could have written the experience as my worst nightmare but as we saw daylight at the end of the cave I was overcome with the joy that it was over and felt slightly proud of myself for not having freaked out or started crying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/semuc-champey-24.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We celebrated with a beer at lunch. This was another mistake as straight after that in the peak of the midday sun they send us marching up a never ending flight of steep stairs. At the top you are given precisely 30 seconds to take a photo of the outstanding view of the waterfalls before they send you back down with the promise of a refreshing swim at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/semuc-champey-36.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally we are allowed to enter the star attraction, the waterfalls. There are seven pools in total and the guide took is through most of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/semuc-champey-46.jpg" alt="semuc champey pools"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was by far the best part of the day as they had us jumping, swimming and sliding between them. It was hard not to feel like a kid again at a water park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/semuc-champey-43.jpg" alt="semuc champey swimming"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling battered and bruised we headed back to the hostel. The day was more adventurous than I had anticipated but turned out to be great fun in what could possibly be the most beautiful place in Guatemala.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;Semuc Champey is not an easy place to get to. From Rio Dulce it&amp;rsquo;s a five hour bus journey through the mountains on mainly unpaved roads. From Antigua it&amp;rsquo;s an 8hr journey but on better roads. So what is it that entices travellers to this remote part of Guatemala? Well the answer is that it is a place of outstanding natural beauty. Photographs will never be able to do this place just...</ContentPreview>

    <Title>Antigua - A City Trapped In Time</Title>
    <TitleURL>guatemala/travel/antigua-a-city-trapped-in-time</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-08-14T01:53:23.663+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;In England, the eight hour bus journey from Lanquin to Antigua would probably be over in less than two hours however the road out of Languin is more like a farmers track than a road, single lane, made of uneven stones and clinging to the side of a mountain. It&amp;rsquo;s a miracle the mini bus can make it across this terrain and even more miraculous that the trucks can make it, as we have to stop and slowly reverse backwards to allow them to past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/antigua-19.jpg" alt="antigua arch long shot"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we hit the paved roads the bus picks up speed but barely goes above 40mph. I call it a road but I&amp;rsquo;m being forgiving. Perhaps Mario Kart would be more appropriate. The driver is clearly well practiced in avoiding the inherent dangers, ranging from landslides which cover half the road, simple pot holes to craters 10 meters long and the width of the road. Dogs sunbathe in the road and refuse to move for cars while drivers use both sides of the road with little regard for oncoming traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/antigua-11.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The road passes through remote villages, winding up and down through mountains and tropical forest until we hit the monolith that is Guatemala City, dirty, big, bustling, and chaotic. The roads here are quite possibly the worst, slowest and heavily polluted we have encountered on this trip. The air is thick with exhaust fumes, well to call them exhaust fumes would be incorrect as clearly having an exhaust is not a requirement here. After dropping off some passengers the bus slowly escapes the manic streets as we head on into Antigua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/antigua-7.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Antigua is Guatemala&amp;rsquo;s flagship tourist town and a hub for international travellers who use it as a base to explore the rest of Guatemala or stay for weeks and learn Spanish at the cheapest prices on the planet. Once the colonial capital of Guatemala, Antigua was abandoned after an earth quake and the capital was moved to Guatemala City. It now stands nearly 500 years old as a snapshot in time, this is Guatemala&amp;rsquo;s answer to York or Bath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/antigua-29.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cobbled streets are lined with crumbling colonial style buildings which are painted in an array of pastel colours. All this is set against the dramatic backdrop of four glorious volcanos, Pacaya, Agua, Acatenango and Fuego. It is the latter of these, which name means fire, which surprised us on our first night in the city. From our hotel we had clear views of this active volcano as it spewed lava and shot clouds of ash into the air. An amazing sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/antigua-14.jpg" alt="antigua arch and volcanoe"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a number of museums and historical sites in Antigua as well as numerous Spanish schools. All the standard tourist stores exists selling a whole range of souvenirs and useless junk that we can&amp;rsquo;t or just won&amp;rsquo;t carry in our bags. Although many are put off by the tourist vibe of the city we found it a pleasure to spend a few days relaxing and enjoying the wide variety of cuisine available. Everything from BBQ meat, Indians, Chinese, Italian, Mexican, and of course Guatemalan, can be found. After being so far from&amp;nbsp;civilisation for so long this was welcomed and we used it as a chance to recharge our batteries before taking on the challenge of a lifetime and ascending the nearby volcano Acatenengo.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Trekking Volcano Acetenango</Title>
    <TitleURL>guatemala/walking-and-trekking/trekking-volcano-acetenango</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-08-14T23:34:57.287+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t leave Antigua without taking a trek up one of the volcanoes and there are tour operators on every corner trying to sell you some sort of deal. We had heard through other travellers that the Acatenango two day sunrise trek was the best and naively did very little research before booking the trip. We saw the trip advertised all over the city with prices ranging from US$90 to as little at 200Q. We ended up booking through our hotel with a tour company called Sin Limitless Travel for 300Q per person. Our advice if you are planning on doing this trip is to do research beforehand as you will see from our experience this can dramatically affect your experience of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/acetenango-and-fuego-2.jpg" alt="acetenango and fuego volcanoes"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was 8pm on the night before we were due to begin the trek and we were getting our things prepared. We had no idea what to expect as the guy we booked the tour through spoke very little English. Luckily for us Karl decided to look on the internet to see what we needed to bring. The reviews shocked us. We had packed small day bags expecting our &amp;lsquo;all inclusive&amp;rsquo; trip to include food water and all the camping gear. It turns out that not all the tours are the same and on most you are expected to bring your own water and are expected to carry your own camping gear. After a painful telephone conversation with the tour operator we found that this was indeed the case. We needed to bring four liters of water and a bag big enough to carry a sleeping bag, tent and mat. It was a good job we found this out as we were about to turn up with a small day bag and no water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/acatenango-22.jpg" alt="acatenego equipment"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we boarded the bus in the morning it soon became apparent that the other people on the trip had not been given the message. We watched people board with small day packs, sandshoes, and with little or no water. Another important factor which the tour operator fails to brief people on is the fact the volcano reaches a height of 3,976m at a height when it will be both freezing cold and the altitude can have severe effects on people. Instead they hand out bottles of rum for us to drink at the top!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m begining to get slightly concerned, a lot of the people in our group are young travellers, they don&amp;rsquo;t seem to have been given any information, they have little clothes, and they are being sent up to almost 4000m with a bottle of rum. This does not seem sensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/acatenango-6.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to reassure myself that people do this every day, it can&amp;rsquo;t be that bad. The other people on the bus begin to realise they may be in the shit as they begin handing out huge sleeping bags, tents and mats. One girl had actually brought a shoulder bag and hula hoops on the trek, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where she thought she was going. With no way of fitting these additional items into most people&amp;rsquo;s bags the guides conveniently offer to sell people bigger bags if they need them, but as our group consists of over 30 people they soon run out of these so people are forced to attach the items to their small bags using pieces of string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/acatenango-10.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were lucky that we had done some research and brought our bigger bags on the trip which could fit everything in. The problem I had was that, along with 4 litres of water, food and several layers of clothes I couldn&amp;rsquo;t actually lift my bag and only just about managed to hurl it onto my back as we began to hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walk is relentlessly uphill, as you would expect from a volcano trek, but the first section is particularly steep. I struggle as each step on the rocky ground takes me two steps up and one step down. Within 10 minutes I realise there is no way I can carry this bag to the top. I spot that one of the girls doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a bag. It turns out there is an option to pay to put the bag onto a horse for an additional 200Q. This may seem an obscene amount of money considering the whole trip cost 300Q but it is the best &amp;pound;18 I have spent. Although I later realise this is only for one way and have to pay again to have the bag taken back down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free of my 7 stone load I am able to enjoy the walk which is still strenuous even without carrying anything. I watch as people struggle up the path, dragging tents along the ground beside them. It seems some people have just now realised what they have signed themselves up for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/acatenango-2.jpg" alt="acatenengo mule"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guides that take us up the mountain are friendly enough but they don&amp;rsquo;t speak any English and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure they aren&amp;rsquo;t first aid trained. Thankfully we all make it safely to camp. Although as Karl powered up with his huge bag the altitude had started to effect his head and make him nauseous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We arrive at camp just below the summit in the middle of a cloud so we weren&amp;rsquo;t even rewarded with a view. The sun goes down and the temperature is beginning to drop. We are well over 3000m and it&amp;rsquo;s getting chilly. This becomes more of an issue for the two German guys who have only brought shorts, t-shits, a light jacket and a thin blanket. They are forced to wear their sleeping bags as they huddle by the fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We crack on with making our tents. On the bus we had been told we were given a four man tent to share with another couple from Holland. When we begin to unfold the tent it quickly becomes obvious that this is a two man tent and instead of a rain cover they have provided us with a sheet of tarpaulin. I&amp;rsquo;m less than impressed. But apparently shouting and swearing in English to the Spanish speaking guides will get you nowhere. As I being moving mine and Karl&amp;rsquo;s stuff in the tent claiming it for ourselves, Karl and the guy from Holland manage to inform the guides that we have a problem. The result is one of the guides has to forfeit his bed for the night and we are left with the tarpaulin tent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/acatenango-57.jpg" alt="acetango view"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other peoples tents are just as bad providing no protection if it begins to rain. Some people tell horror stories of other groups whose tents flooded and all their clothes were soaked. This would have been extremely dangerous considering the freezing temperatures outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/acatenango-60.jpg" alt="acetenango trek tent"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully the clouds cleared and we were able to catch a glimpse of the breathtakingly beautiful views of the volcanoes with Antigua and Guatemala City nestled below. Once clear you can see for miles. We can also now appreciate how close we are to the active volcano Fuego which looks a stone's throw away. It provides us with an awesome show of lava being thrown into the air and then gushing down the side solidifying as the roaring sounds echo through the hills making us fully appreciate the power of the earth on which we stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/volcan_fuego_eruption.jpg" alt="fuego eruption"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We eat our noodles by the fire watching other groups dine on tortillas, salad and meat but manage to make the best of the situation by roasting marshmallows. A lot of the group drink the rum. We are clearly getting sensible in our old age as we stick to the hot chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our tent I wear all the clothes I have brought and get into the sleeping bag and I am still cold. I can only imagine what the others, which have a lot less than me, be must be feeling. The best quote of the trip comes from a guy who shouts &amp;ldquo;do you think we can ask the guides if we can move the tents closer to the lava?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sleep surprisingly well only waking up a few times in a panic thinking I could hear it rain. Thankfully it didn&amp;rsquo;t. Karl on the other hand has a sleepless night and looks unimpressed when the guides get us up at 4.30am to hike to the top for sunrise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we get up it seems the lack of clothes and possibly the effect of the rum is preventing some of the group even attempting the top. One guy who began the hike in a second hand pair of Oasis trainers is forced to say at the camp as the sole of his shoe has fell off, another is using a towel as a make shift skirt as he only has shorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/acatenango-30.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the last of the night&amp;rsquo;s shadow, guided by torch light we begin storming up the mountain and I struggle to catch my breath and begin to feel sick. The path is steep, its dark and the ground is like sand. Picture walking up sand dunes at altitude and you will get an idea of how hard it is..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/acatenango-36.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an hour the sun begins to rise over Guatemala City, clouds patiently wait below us clinging to the volcano and the first glimpses of the new day colour the sky an awesome orange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/acatenango-48.jpg" alt="acetenango sunrise"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a strenuous 90 minute hike to the top. Some people don&amp;rsquo;t make it and at some points I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can either but with Karl&amp;rsquo;s words of encouragement we reach the summit. Tears being to well up as I take in the spectacular view. This only lasts a second as the clouds soon come in and the icy winds cause my fingers to throb painfully. This soon becomes too much to bear and although I would have loved to stay to see an eruption from the top I am forced to go back down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/acatenango-44.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back down is easier although the ground is extremely slippery. After we pack up camp we begin the decent. It is on the way down that we can truly appreciate the height we have reached as we passed through four micro ecosystems including alpine and cloud forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/acatenango-52.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After falling over several times on the way down we reach the bottom, battered and bruised but glad to be in one piece. Apart from the fact we could well have died on the volcano, the experience was truly spectacular and the views were undoubtably some of the best we will ever see. It was a shame that the lack of information and preparation meant the trip was more difficult that it needed to be as well as potentially being dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our advice to any other people doing the trip would be to do plenty of research beforehand. It may well pay off to go for a more expensive tour. Make sure you pack plenty of warm clothes, water and snacks. Wear sensible comfortable shoes and check the tents you are provided with are adequate before you begin. Other than that, it is a hard hike, but well worth the effort for this once in a lifetime experience.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t leave Antigua without taking a trek up one of the volcanoes and there are tour operators on every corner trying to sell you some sort of deal. We had heard through other travellers that the Acatenango two day sunrise trek was the best and naively did very little research before booking the trip. We saw the trip advertised all over the city with prices ranging from US$90 to as l...</ContentPreview>

    <Title>San Marcos – Realigning our chakras in hippy heaven </Title>
    <TitleURL>guatemala/travel/san-marcos-realigning-our-chakras-in-hippy-heaven</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-08-30T14:39:30.87+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;San Marcos is a small village set on the shores of Lake Atitlan. The views are particularly splendid from this point as set in front are two volcanos which crown the lake. The waters in this area are rumoured to have mystical powers which has meant this is now a haven for new age hippies to congregate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-marcos-(4).jpg" alt="lake atitlan view from san marcos"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only one main street in San Marcos but there are posters everywhere offering different types of therapies, treatments and massages, as well as yoga, meditation, chanting and chakra aligning. You can get your tarot read, your palm read and also your mind read. You can be cleansed with herbs, flowers or Chinese cups. If it&amp;rsquo;s crazy and &amp;lsquo;out there&amp;rsquo; you will most defiantly find it here. We even found some therapies designed for the modern day vampires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-marcos-(3).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved the place. Karl was not so keen. I was willing to embrace the new experiences. Karl, on the other hand, wanted to get the boat to San Pedro to drink beer in the English pub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, in the four days we were in San Marcos we both sampled a few of the offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction to Meditation &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays a two hour introduction to meditation course takes place at Hostel La Pez. For 40Q per person you are talked through the basic techniques. This turned out to be Karl&amp;rsquo;s favourite activity, mainly because you got to spend two hours lying on your back listening to relaxing music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-marcos-(22).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yoga&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We stayed in Hostel de la Lago which is the best place to do yoga in San Marcos. The hostel has its own platform on the lake which has the best views. There are yoga classes&amp;rsquo; every day at 7.30am and 9am for 40Q pp. During our stay we attended three different yoga classes each offering a different styles. The views are amazing and even more spectacular in the morning sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-marcos-(15).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holistic therapies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During our stay we decided that we would each have one of the treatments on offer. After much deliberation I decided not to do the flower therapy but to go for a necessary beauty treatment instead. Karl went for a more alternative massage called trigger point therapy, although we are both sceptical of these things he said it did help ease the pain in his calf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-marcos-(18).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Herbal Remedies &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At our hostel they held a two hour introduction to herbal remedies class which I attended. Karl declined saying it was a load of bollocks. I went into the class more open minded. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say I learnt anything revolutionary although it has inspired me to grow a herbal garden when I get back home and to experiment with tea infusions, although I&amp;rsquo;m not expecting the teas to perform miracles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were only a few sections which mentioned growing plants in line with the moons cycles and drying herbs in the sun to absorb the suns energy that I thought may be leaning slightly more to the crazy side, but overall it was a good way to spend the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-marcos-(23).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After four days we both had enough of being woken up at 4am with chanting and we had seen enough women with hairy armpits to last a lifetime. So with a stretched, cleansed and glowing body we jump in a boat and head over the lake to the backpacker friendly town of San Pedro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karl almost ran there for fear that I suggest we stay and make him take part in the story telling circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>San Pedro - The perfect place to learn Spanish</Title>
    <TitleURL>guatemala/travel/san-pedro-the-perfect-place-to-learn-spanish</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-08-30T14:52:01.547+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Looking from the road above, San Pedro looks perfect, the town is nestled at the foot of a volcano of the same name. It&amp;rsquo;s one of three volcanoes that surround Lake Atitlan and from this view the landscape looks exceptional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-pedro-atitlan--(49).jpg" alt="san pedro sun rise - Lake atitlan"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We took a boat from San Marcos to San Pedro where we rode&amp;nbsp;in the back of a tuk-tuk to the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-pedro-atitlan--(39).jpg" alt="san pedro atitlan main street with tuk tuk"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is San Pedro tranquil and serene the temperature here is perfectly suited to us British. Being at altitude the temperature is much cooler than the rest of Central America where it&amp;rsquo;s hot and sticky all day and night. During the day it&amp;rsquo;s warm enough to sunbathe but not so hot that you can&amp;rsquo;t walk around. At night it cools enough that you can sleep comfortably without a fan or air con.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;San Pedro Spanish School&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason for visiting San Pedro was&amp;nbsp;to learn Spanish at one of the many language schools. We chose to study at San Pedro Spanish School. And the choice was a good one, for two weeks we studied by the side of the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-pedro-atitlan--(9).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was the perfect place to study, absolutely beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-pedro-atitlan--(6).jpg" alt="lake atitlan view from san pedro spanish school"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We tried to speak Spanish with our fantastic teacher Abner but being realistic I&amp;rsquo;m sure we were talking some sort of Geordie Spanglish. But the humming birds that floated by had no idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-pedro-atitlan--(8).jpg" alt="Lake atitlan humming bird from san pedro spanish school"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the two weeks we graduated, were given a certificate and had to say a few words in Spanish to the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fb-root"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few words in Spanish to thank the teacher and school&lt;/p&gt;
Posted by &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/IntrepidNomads"&gt;Intrepid Nomads&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, August 31, 2015&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although we are far from fluent, we have learnt some useful skills to aid the rest of our trip and to complement our pointing and hand signals we have been using to get by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hotel Mikaso&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we are staying here for two weeks we have decided to stay in one of the nicest hotel in San Pedro, Hotel Mikaso. Although it&amp;rsquo;s still incredibly cheap by British standards it&amp;rsquo;s the most expensive place we have stayed in Guatemala. For the price you get such luxuries as private bathroom with a hot shower, fresh towels and a change of bed sheets every day. Usually these things are taken for granted, right now we really appreciate the simple things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that after Spanish school every day we sun bathed on the roof terrace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-pedro-atitlan--(40).jpg" alt="hotel mikaso sun terrace"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And chilled out in the hot tub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-pedro-atitlan--(42).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We lived like kings in blissed out perfection&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Around San Predro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After travelling for so long you start to lose track of the days through lack of routine but in San Pedro we got into quite a good routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nufos gym is near the San Marcos dock and this is where we spent an hour each afternoon after sunbathing. Somehow going to the gym is much more pleasurable when you don&amp;rsquo;t have to go to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-pedro-atitlan--(36).jpg" alt="san pedro atitlan nufos gym"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then when the evening came we went out to one of many fine places for incredibly cheap and tasty food. Life here was perfect and you really feel like there&amp;rsquo;s really no reason to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The owner of the Alegre pub felt just the same, having arrived as a backpacker 13 years ago he never left. The owner originally from Dundee has packed the menu full of home comfort food including English breakfast, pie and mash, Sunday roast and curries which made a welcome change from the Central American cuisine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s not the only one who fell for the charm of San Pedro, there is a lively ex pat community here and they are incredibly welcoming and friendly. There&amp;rsquo;s people from England including Manchester and London as well as several other European countries, even some Japanese who came here and simply never left. It&amp;rsquo;s really not hard to see why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;San Pedro is perhaps one of the cheapest places we have ever been to, for example on Wednesday Albert Bar does all you can drink beer for 50 Quetzals, that&amp;rsquo;s about &amp;pound;4.50. The same price as a pint in Manchester. But to be honest I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I can even drink 50Q worth of beer anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Saturdays at El Barrio you can treat yourself to an all-you-can-eat Champagne brunch for 40Q. You get three course cooked for you and a glass of champagne to boot. In pounds that &amp;pound;3.40! Not a bad deal. And on Wednesday there is a pub quiz, which we almost won. We came second with the help of the local book store owner, who was very nice and intelligent man but happened to have the appearance of having drunk too much not only that night but every night previously for several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chi Chi Market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chichicastenango, or simply Chi Chi is claimed to hold the biggest market in Central America. Located in the Guatemalan highlands a short bus ride from San Pedro. Chi Chi is the perfect place for the local villager&amp;rsquo;s and surrounding communities to gather to sell their produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-pedro-atitlan--(13).jpg" alt="chi chi market"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chi Chi was amazing, held on Thursdays and Sundays the locals travel to the town the day before to set up there stalls. Women and children dressed in the most fantastically colourful dresses come to purchase fresh fruits, vegetables and meats to cook with and colourful fabrics to make clothes for the family. Once you have done some shopping it&amp;rsquo;s the perfect place to take a seat and people watch or to simply admire the Guatemalan way of life in full flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-pedro-atitlan--(19).jpg" alt="chi chi market "   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kayaking Lake Atitlan.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good way to explore the lake is to hire a kayak which can be rented for 15Q per hour. This was Leanne&amp;rsquo;s first time in a kayak and she picked it up straight away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-pedro-atitlan--(24).jpg" alt="kayak late atitlan"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;El Nariz de Indio (The Indians Nose)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was hard to force ourselves to get up at half three in the morning. The taxi picked us up at four on the dot. An hour or so later we arrived at another village, we headed out in the dark through corn fields with a young boy perhaps only ten or twelve who was to be our guide. He had with him an incredibly vicious and badly behaved dog as his protection. The 45 minute walk up a steep hill was hard going but the views from the summit were breath taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-pedro-atitlan--(44).jpg" alt="lake atitlan sunrise"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we caught our breath the sun was beginning to show on the horizon on the far side of Lake Atitlan lighting up the sky and clouds that lay beyond the volcanoes that shadowed the lake. Along the lake edge dotted between the volcanoes the lights of the villages glowed in the darkness. It was an amazing sight and fantastically beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-pedro-atitlan--(47).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We sat for a while and admired the beauty of the lake in the darkness and then headed a further five minutes up the path to the top of the Indians nose where we sat and watched the sunrise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-pedro-atitlan--(55).jpg" alt="lake atitlan"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three volcanoes of Lake Atitlan can clearly be seen and in the distance we could see Acetenango and Fuego the volcanoes we climbed the week before. Only today there is no cloud around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-pedro-atitlan--(58).jpg" alt="atitlan sunrise from indians nose"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again the beauty of Guatemala has astounded us. We make our way back down in to the waiting taxi and go straight back to bed satisfied that it was all worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending two weeks in San Pedro we really need to make a move before we become one of those who never leave. San Pedro really is one of the wonderful places which we&amp;nbsp;will never forget.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;For cheaper than the price of Greggs sausage roll you can get yourself a bottle of Quezalteca. Other than the Guatemalan coffee we have found few other unique drinks in this part of the world. Perhaps we have not been looking hard enough but there was no need to look for Quezalteca, it had a strange habit of finding us in the most peculiar of places. We have drank this deep in the jungle, carried it up volcanoes and drank it watching the sunset beside spectacular lakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/quezalteca.jpg" alt="quezalteca "   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quezalteca is for sale behind the counter in every shop and generally comes in three varieties. The first is the plain unflavoured Quezalteca. However we would recommend the flavoured varieties Rosa de Jamaica and Tamarind. Tamarind is 25% and requires a good shake before it is drinkable as the tamarind flavouring tends to settle at the bottom. Don&amp;rsquo;t be put off by this it has a unique but easily drinkable taste, slightly too sweet to drink a lot of and mixed with a bitter tamarind flavour that is likely to stay with you for at least 20 mins after your swig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our favourite of the two is Rosa de Jamaica not only is this much stronger at 36% offering even better value for money it is also a pleasure to drink. It is just sweet enough to mask the strong alcohol with a taste not to dissimilar to cherry. If possible, stick the bottle in a fridge or over ice and drink it with a squeeze of lime and this becomes seriously good drink. Highly recommended to any budget traveller in Guatemala.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;We decided not to do much travelling in El Salvador and Honduras. The decision was easy to make as there is some serious problems in these countries due to gang violence. Honduras has the highest murder rate in the world and El Salvador the second. We had seen in the paper that in El Salvador there was 125 murders in 3 days and 677 in July in a month of deadly violence. Honduras had more than 7000 murders reported last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main gangs MS13, Barrio 18 and the Mexican cartels fight mainly for control of the cocaine smuggling business. The gangs actually started in America as Central Americans originally went to the states as war refugees, after the war they were sent home and the gang culture was taken with them.&lt;br /&gt;However a few places in Honduras are unaffected, the main tourist attractions such as the Bay Islands in the Caribbean are far enough away from the main land to be affected and the ruins of Copan on the Guatemalan border ae also relatively safe and popular with tourists. However neither of these was on our to-do list. It was a similar situation with El Salvador the things we really wanted to do were in Guatemala and Nicaragua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We still had to go through both El Salvador and Honduras to get to Nicaragua but realistically we were unlikely to be effected by the violence. We weren&amp;rsquo;t going through any of the major cities and we are neither involved with drugs or gangs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two options to get to Nicaragua were to take the Tica bus which was the cheapest option and took 36 hours, the second option was the more expensive private shuttle bus that took 24 hours. Neither of which we felt like we could handle. So we decided to take a stop in El Salvador at the popular surfing and party town of El Tunco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;El Tunco&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took ten hours to get to El Tunco, the border crossing into El Salvador was painless. The first thing that we noticed about El Salvador is that it appears much more developed the Guatemala, the roads are in good condition and the drive to El Tunco is smooth. As we got out the van to cross the border we noticed the temperature increased making it feel hot and sticky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-tunco-3.jpg" alt="el tunco rocks"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Tunco is primarily a surfer town and party town. It&amp;rsquo;s small and well developed with lots of bars and restaurants and of course there&amp;rsquo;s good surf, we spent the evening drinking beer watching the sunset over the rocky volcanic beach whilst the surfers played in the ocean waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-tunco-2.jpg" alt="el tunco sunset"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For us the party was short lived, none of the three cash machines give out any money, so with only $20 left between us we had a slight problem. How were we going to pay for the hotel and pay for a bus to Nicaragua? We were not the only ones, another girl in the hostel tried going to the town if La Libertad and still couldn&amp;rsquo;t get any money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We tried to pay for the hotel and the card didn&amp;rsquo;t work but it was a relief when the second card worked. We also had to pay for the shuttle bus on card both of which added a 10% surcharge.&lt;br /&gt;We left for Nicaragua with $3 dollars between us in the hope that there would be a cash machine on the way as we needed $18 dollars per person to get through the border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We stopped a the shopping mall at La Libertad and tried 3 cash machines, none of which would give us any money. We were getting quite worried by the lack of cash when at last the fourth cash machine gave us some money, we let out a huge sigh of relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever go to El Tunco we advise you to take plenty of cash with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Honduras To Nicaragua&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We passed through the Honduran border relatively easily and drove for around 4 hours, all we really saw was from the window of the van and the American style service station at which we stopped for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/honduras-2.jpg" alt="Honduras border control from El Salvador"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The border to Nicaragua took much longer to pass, the van had to be fumigated and the driver spent several hours getting our passports checked. We were really thankful we paid a tour company to take us through all the borders as it really simplified the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/honduras-3.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once through the border we continued the journey to Leon driving through a fantastical electric storm as the light faded and so ended a journey that took us through 3 countries in one day and lasted over nearly 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Volcano Boarding Cerro Negro</Title>
    <TitleURL>nicaragua/travel/volcano-boarding-cerro-negro</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-09-05T01:04:06.187+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;So we had made it into Nicaragua, aka the land of fire. No longer content with simple hiking up these powerful giants we now were provided with the opportunity to throw ourselves down them on a plank of wood known as Volcano Boarding. This was an opportunity we weren&amp;rsquo;t going to turn down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the city of Leon it&amp;rsquo;s a short bus ride to El Cerro Negro which is one of the youngest active volcanos on the continent. It has erupted from several points causing it to have more than one crater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we approach it from the bus it looks like a huge black hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/volcanoe-boarding-leon-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its 35 degrees outside but thankfully there is a small amount of cloud providing some minor rest bite from the sun as we are handed our backpacks with overalls, goggles and our board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/volcanoe-boarding-leon-7.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We begin the 45 minute hike up the volcano. This is the bit I wasn&amp;rsquo;t looking forward to. The boards aren&amp;rsquo;t exactly the easiest things to carry and as we get closer to the top the wind picks up and it becomes difficult to hold onto the board without flying away with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/volcanoe-boarding-leon-10.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully the walk isn&amp;rsquo;t too long and before we know it we have reached the top. We spend a few moments exploring the edge of one of the craters which is steaming. The ground is boiling hot and the wind blows the heated air in our faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/volcanoe-boarding-leon-9.jpg" alt="volcano boarding"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hot enough as it is but then we are told to put on our overalls. Obviously mine is several sizes too big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/volcanoe-boarding-leon-24.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly we aren&amp;rsquo;t going to win any style awards in these outfits but I&amp;rsquo;ll wear anything as long as it&amp;rsquo;s providing some sort of protection if we fall. By this point I have realised it isn&amp;rsquo;t going to be anything like snowboarding, the ground isn&amp;rsquo;t like sand it&amp;rsquo;s made of small, hard rocks. But we are here now and it has to be more fun than walking down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/volcanoe-boarding-leon-28.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being told that people have reached speeds of 90km per hour going down we are given a short tutorial in how to not fall off the board. I listen intently. I&amp;rsquo;m determined that I&amp;rsquo;m not going to fall off as I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure Volcano Boarding isn&amp;rsquo;t covered on our travel insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/volcanoe-boarding-leon-29.jpg" alt="volcano boarding lion setting off"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guide told us that the first section is a 45 degree slope which then turns to a 50 degree angle. If we don&amp;rsquo;t want to go too fast he tells us to start off slowly as you will pick up speed further down. I take this advice and edge slowly down the slope, very slowly in fact. As I struggle to pick up speed I pick my feet up and immediately start to hurtle down. The board is not easy to handle so I dig my feet in to the ground to regain control. This works surprisingly well as I slow down and at one point and it looks like I may even stop. I don&amp;rsquo;t break any speed records but I do make it to the bottom safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watch Karl coming down, faster than me but also leaning more toward the cautious side. We then watch the crazy speed demons zoom down and some nutters with snowboards boarding down standing up. We were both saying we regretted not going faster when one girl comes down screaming, she is flying down and has clearly lost control, suddenly she is flung off the board a few feet into the air and rolls several times down the hill. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t look good. I&amp;rsquo;m immediately glad that I took the cautious approach. She is part of another group so we don&amp;rsquo;t get to see what the damage was but she would be lucky to come out with just a few scratches and bruises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although our runs weren&amp;rsquo;t as adrenaline pumping as we may have liked this is still an extreme sport and a lot of fun. I was glad to do it but equally glad to have walked out without any broken bones.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;So we had made it into Nicaragua, aka the land of fire. No longer content with simple hiking up these powerful giants we now were provided with the opportunity to throw ourselves down them on a plank of wood known as Volcano Boarding. This was an opportunity we weren&amp;rsquo;t going to turn down.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Revolution and Culture in Leon</Title>
    <TitleURL>nicaragua/travel/revolution-and-culture-in-leon</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-09-05T01:07:49.523+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Cities usually aren&amp;rsquo;t always our favourite place, busy, crowded, the same stores and always more expensive. So the plan was to go to Le&amp;oacute;n and stay two days and move on, but we were in for a pleasant surprise and ended up staying for five days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/leon-nicaragua-1.jpg" alt="leon nicargua"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Le&amp;oacute;n is a city we came and fell in love with, with fantastic crumbling Spanish colonial buildings providing the backdrop for a city which is as politically intriguing as it is cultural and intellectual. There&amp;rsquo;s a plethora of places to eat and not a McDonalds in sight. As it is a student city there is something going on every night of the week. It&amp;rsquo;s also incredibly cheap, which is ideal for us, and surprisingly it&amp;rsquo;s not too touristy giving a real insight into the Nicaraguan psyche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Things to do in Le&amp;oacute;n&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cathedral and Churches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all Spanish colonial cities the biggest and most spectacular architectures are the dominating churches. No visit is complete without a quick tour of the city to see the grand crumbling facades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/leon-nicaragua-10.jpg" alt="leon nicaagua"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The central plaza is dominated by the cathedral, the best bit about this is taking the stairs to the roof where you are instructed to remove your shoes and then with little regard for safety you can wander and climb over the white domes on the roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/leon-nicaragua-4.jpg" alt="leon cathedral roof"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With fantastic views of the city in all directions you can see the volcanoes in the horizon that surround the city. It&amp;rsquo;s well worth the $1 dollar fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/leon-nicaragua-11.jpg" alt="leon Nicaragua cathedral roof view"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Museo de la Revolucion (Museum of the Revolution)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directly in front of the cathedral across the plaza is the museum of the revolution. For a small fee of $2 dollars you get a guided tour in Spanish of the museum. It&amp;rsquo;s a good job we took some Spanish lessons as this place is no ordinary museum, it&amp;rsquo;s really just a room with photographs depicting the history running up to Sandinista revolution of 1979. We were welcomed to the museum by a man who looked similar to Che Guevera and guided around by a Nicaraguan who appears in the actual photographs on display, what really makes this place special is that its ran by the actual revolutionaries of the time. As our guide says he is living history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/leon-nicaragua-14.jpg" alt="Museo de la Revolucion (Museum of the Revolution)"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there&amp;rsquo;s also a great photo opportunity with a rocket launcher, the guide at this point was giving the two finger salute and shouting &amp;ldquo;Via La Revolution&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/leon-nicaragua-16.jpg" alt="Museo de la Revolucion rocket launcher"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mural below is at the back of the museum and show the revolutionaries on the left, most notably Augusto Sandio (a huge national hero) and Che Guvera in the centre. Other people on display included the now dead Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/leon-nicaragua-24.jpg" alt="libertadores de latinoamerica"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour continued around the building which ironically is the old palace of the Somza government and ended with a walk on the roof for good views of the plaza and surrounding city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Museo de Tradiciones y Leyendas (Museum of Legend and Traditions)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will either love or hate this place, we happened to love its quirky, confused and at times ridiculous displays of legends of Nicaragua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The museum starts with a tank that was used in the revolution. The museum itself is an old prison which explains the murals on the walls and the small display of photographs at the beginning. But that&amp;rsquo;s about as serious as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next room is filled with a rather strange paper mache figure of the now deceased creator of the museum with some of her possessions including her wheel chair and telephone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/leon-nicaragua-25.jpg" alt="Museo de Tradiciones y Leyendas creator with wheel chair"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is room after room of paper mache figures and in each the guide tells us the story behind each one. The guide, although very nice, speaks very fast English and sounds like he was taught by a cross between Stephen Hawking and R2D2 making it a little difficult to catch the story behind each one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not quite sure what this rather creepy woman (below) is doing or her story but it looks like she&amp;rsquo;s from the film &amp;lsquo;The Ring&amp;rsquo;, most the figures look scary and I would not want to spend a night in any of these rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/leon-nicaragua-35.jpg" alt="ring look alike"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some stories we remember are this &amp;ldquo;El Duende&amp;rdquo; which steals children and makes them disappear&amp;hellip; (I&amp;rsquo;m sure I have seen him before in England at the garden centre)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/leon-nicaragua-37.jpg" alt="El Duende in museum  in leon"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this woman, who the guide pauses for and says &amp;lsquo;Big tits woman&amp;rsquo;. We are then informed that local men in the village are attracted to her &amp;lsquo;big tits&amp;rsquo; and when they suck the tit they are killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/leon-nicaragua-38.jpg" alt="museum of ledgends and traditions big tits women"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is literally hundreds of these figures, I can&amp;rsquo;t decide if it&amp;rsquo;s good or bad. In a way it&amp;rsquo;s rather ridiculous and we did well not to start laughing but in others it&amp;rsquo;s incredibly interesting and rewarding. Either way we enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Museo de Arte Fundaci&amp;oacute;n Ortiz-Guardi&amp;aacute;n&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fine collection of Central American art is well worth a look and probably one of the best in Central America. This would not look out of place in any European city and we appeared to be the only one there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;House of Ruben Dario&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rubian Dario is revered in Nicaragua as a national hero in the same way we in England idolise Shakespeare. Along with Sandino he appears everywhere. They appear at the airport as a huge painting, as statues in the streets and plazas and not surprisingly as paper maches figures in the museum of legends and traditions. His home which is now a museum contains some of his possessions including, letters, poems, his bed and most interestingly a rather worn gargoyle from the Houses of Parliament. Needless to say our visit here was swift and we made a speedy exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hit the market in search of Iguanas to eat, although we never found any cooked for us to take away we did find a stall selling them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/leon-nicaragua-47.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And swiftly decided that the idea of preparing lizard to eat ourselves was a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Night Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is loads of bars and restaurants to eat and drink at and it&amp;rsquo;s really, really cheap. We had a night out with food, live Latino music and plenty to drink for under &amp;pound;10. And &amp;pound;2 was charged for a replacement cocktail glass after I knocked it over! We spent a few nights out and even hit the night clubs although these are more expensive as they charge an entrance fee. A lesson learnt learnt is don&amp;rsquo;t try to get in in shorts, it may be 35C but you will get turned away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volcano Boarding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people come to Leon with the sole purpose of throwing themselves down a volcano on a wooden board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/volcanoe-boarding-leon-29.jpg" alt="volcano boarding leon"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leon is a fantastic place to visit and a great introduction to Nicaraguan culture and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>A Caribbean Getaway on the Corn Islands</Title>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Las Islas del Ma&amp;iacute;z or Corn Islands to us English speakers are located 70 kilometres East of Nicaragua in the South Caribbean sea. The name itself sparked Karl&amp;rsquo;s interest as he has suffered a lifelong allergy to this popular food. Hoping that he would not have any adverse reactions to the Island itself we began making plans to head over to these small pieces of paradise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/corn-islands-10.jpg" alt="little corn harbour"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Leon we decided to take the more expensive but more convenient flight from Managua Airport. The cheaper alternative option is to travel by bus for 6 hours across the country to Blue Fields and then jump on an overnight cargo ship which leaves for the island twice weekly. Although this would cost a fraction of the price of flying we decided the effort was not worth saving the money for. Also, taking the journey on the small 12 man plane (14 including the two pilots) was part of the fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/corn-islands-39.jpg" alt="plane to corn islands"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People may hate us for saying this but although our life is like one long holiday at the moment, booking a week in the Caribbean felt like a mini holiday..from our long holiday. I would hate us too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/corn-islands-19.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Isles are a lot different from the more well know Caribbean Islands which have been overrun by hotels. From the air you can see that most of the land remains untouched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/corn-islands-44.jpg" alt="big corn ariel"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/corn-islands-43.jpg" alt="big corn from above"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big Corn, not surprisingly the larger of the two, is 10 square kilometres. We only flew into this Island and headed straight to the boat to take the bumpy 30 minute ride over to Little Corn. At only 2.9 square kilometres the palm tree fringed Isla surrounded by turquoise waters and white sands was to be our paradise island for a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/corn-islands-17.jpg" alt="little corn remote beach"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now there isn&amp;rsquo;t a lot to do in paradise. But isn&amp;rsquo;t that the point. We managed to fill our days with the following activities;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exploring the island and finding our own deserted beaches to bathe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading a book or admiring the view from our cabana on the beach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/corn-islands-3.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Snorkelling in one of the best coral reefs we have seen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/corn-islands-28.jpg" alt="snorkelling little corn"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eating lobster in one of the many delicious restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drinking rum, which we believe is actually mandatory in the Caribbean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Star Gazing &amp;ndash; At night the island sky shines with the clear view of thousands of stars and the Milky Way. You can guide your way down the unlit paths by following the glow of the fireflies which dance around you. Truly magical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eating coconuts -The island is filled with these tasty superfood. Walking along in the heat, mildly dehydrated from last night&amp;rsquo;s rum, Karl enjoyed the luxury of being able to pick these from the trees or from the floor and drink their refreshing juices. The hard effort of getting into them clearly being worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/corn-islands-37.jpg" alt="finding coconut on little corn"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/corn-islands-38.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our only worry on the Island was to watch out for coconuts falling on our heads as apparently they kill approximately 150 people a year worldwide. Something to keep in mind while relaxing in your hammock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our week on the island flew by too quickly and soon we were boarding the plane again, however unlike the end of a holiday there was no sickly feeling in the pit of our stomachs at the thought of returning to work. Instead we skipped onto the plane excited to explore the rest of what Nicaragua has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to hate us.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Flor de Cana</Title>
    <TitleURL>nicaragua/drink-reviews/flor-de-cana</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-09-15T16:20:12.27+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;So here we find ourselves again at the end of a hard days travelling sitting in our rocking chairs with the familiar taste of Flor de Ca&amp;ntilde;a to relax our weary bones. Flor de Ca&amp;ntilde;a is without a doubt Nicaragua&amp;rsquo;s number one drink. It is a rum, but it is not like any other rum we have tasted before. The first variety we sampled was the Gran Reserva 7 year aged which was almost too easy to drink straight and only cost a few dollars. Very enjoyable. We have often heard people describe spirits as being &amp;lsquo;smooth&amp;rsquo; but this is the first time we have actually understood what they meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/flor-de-cana-(4).jpg" alt="flor de cana gran reserva"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second variety we tasted was the 5 year aged which is ridiculously cheap. 365ml will cost &amp;pound;2, and again, it is an extremely pleasing drink. The cheaper unaged variety can be found in any rum cocktail in the country and will cost pennies but will not have the aftertaste of paint stripper that is usually the case with cheap cocktails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rum tour of the Flor De Ca&amp;ntilde;a factory, which is available as a daytrip from Leon, looked a worthwhile venture and perhaps would have been a good accompaniment to this post but at $60 per person that equated to almost a life time supply of this tasty drink. Although regrettable, surely the real pleasure is in the drinking and we did plenty of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/flor-de-cana-(2).jpg" alt="flor de cana gran reserva label"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicaragua has exceeded itself with its national drink. Flor de Ca&amp;ntilde;a is certainly a drink to be proud of and as we head over the border to Costa Rica we leave not just with the memories but also with a litre bottle of Flor de Ca&amp;ntilde;a stored in our bags!&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;So here we find ourselves again at the end of a hard days travelling sitting in our rocking chairs with the familiar taste of Flor de Ca&amp;ntilde;a to relax our weary bones.

    <Title>Colonial Splendour in Granada</Title>
    <TitleURL>nicaragua/travel/colonial-splendour-in-granada</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-09-15T16:35:28.033+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Is Granada just another colonial City? Almost all travellers who come to Nicaragua will end up passing through it at some point and of those we questioned the response was similar, it&amp;rsquo;s too touristy and it&amp;rsquo;s just like any other colonial city. So with pretty low expectations we left Managua and arrived at the 500 year old city of Granada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/granada-nicaragua-14.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having low expectations is not such a bad state of affairs, for starters you can&amp;rsquo;t be disappointed and the experience can only get better. We happened to arrive during Independence Day and the atmosphere was electric. It being a national holiday, there were celebrations with bands dressed in local attire playing rhythmical drum beats creating a carnival like ambience throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/granada-nicaragua-3.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than take a ride around the city in the traditional horse and cart we decided, rather unromantically but economically, to take the option to walk the main sites. The first stop was the central plaza and the fantastically colourful cathedral which has been then centrepiece of many a postcard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/images/uploads/medium/granada-nicaragua-5.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Around the central plaza there are colonial buildings, shops, restaurants, crafts and arts and it&amp;rsquo;s a pleasant place to spend an evening. We enjoyed sampling the local dish of Cerdo con Yucca. Which is pork and yucca served on a banana leaf with salad and spicy sauce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/cerdo-con-yuca-1.jpg" alt="cerdo con yuca"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We then made a move to find La Merced Church, the church was first built 1539 and then rebuilt in 1862 has an impressive photogenic fa&amp;ccedil;ade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/granada-nicaragua-7.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In truth we didn&amp;rsquo;t come here to see the church but arrived based on a recommendation to climb the bell tower for views of the city. For $1 you can climb the incredibly narrow and vertigo inducing steps. Once at the top don&amp;rsquo;t ring the bells!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/granada-nicaragua-9.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The views were impressive in all directions with volcanoes lining the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/granada-nicaragua-10.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We continued the self-guided walking tour back across the plaza and down the main tourist street. Lined with bars and restaurants and with outdoors seating on either side this road it has the feel of a Spanish tourist resort. There really is little to see here during the day but its nice place to spend the evening drinking Flor de Cana and people watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We headed further down the road towards the lake and a few horse and carts passed carrying carefree tourists along the road towards the lake. We reached the water and wished we hadn&amp;rsquo;t as there&amp;rsquo;s nothing too see and the heat had taken its toll. We headed back towards the main plaza turning right at another old church towards the Convent of San Francisco where we stopped across the road for a much needed lunch break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/granada-nicaragua-21.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the side of the convent there is a small museum which is worth a quick look. Inside you will find this rather strange scene. Which apparently is a game!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/granada-nicaragua-18.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We finished the day learning about chocolate at the Choco Museo and Caf&amp;eacute; where we tasted quite possibly the finest chocolate ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/granada-nicaragua-23.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granada was actually much better than we expected, it may be touristy but after all we are tourists.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Peering into the gates of hell - Masaya Volcano National Park</Title>
    <TitleURL>nicaragua/travel/peering-into-the-gates-of-hell-masaya-volcano-national-park</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-09-15T16:42:32.507+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;After spending almost two months in Guatemala and Nicaragua you would think we would be all volcanoed out. This was true to a point but when we read about the active volcano Masaya, described be Spaniards as the gate to hell, we were intrigued. I was immediately sold when the travel agent said we didn&amp;rsquo;t have to hike to the top as it was possible to drive to the crater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/masaya-17.jpg" alt="volcano masaya sunset"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour set off from Granada at 3pm and only consisted of ourselves and one other lady. The first stop was a visit to the nearby market town Masaya. This was all well and good but we had seen enough markets selling the same tat so we were ready to skip through it and head to the main attraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/masaya-15.jpg" alt="masaya sunset"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arriving at the entrance to the park you drive past miles of volcanic rock fields showing first-hand the dramatic effect on the surrounding lands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/masaya-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then we drove to the crater. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t hard to spot as it had sulphurous gasses pouring out. Thankfully, due to the wind direction being in our favour, we didn&amp;rsquo;t have to wear masks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/masaya-8.jpg" alt="looking into volcano masaya"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exploring around the area felt like we had arrived in Mordor. Karl was too quick to point out that I could fit the role of the hobbit. However, without a ring to throw into the depths of the earth we headed up a nearby ridge to watch sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/masaya-4.jpg" alt="volocano masaya sunset"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The views were spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/masaya-14.jpg" alt="masaya volcano"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/masaya-16.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the sun disappeared the guide handed us flashlights and helmets and ushered us down to some bat caves where literally hundreds of thousands of bats were heading out for their evening dinner. The guide said they estimate approximately 80,000 living in this one cave. In the dark it was hard to make out individual bats as they swarmed past our heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/masaya-18.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were not the only ones on the lookout for bats as we spotted two hungry snakes lurking around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/masaya-21.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were then led deeper into the caves to see the effect of the lava as it erupted causing these caves to form as the surface lava solidified faster than the molten lava still flowing beneath. What was most impressive was the fact the trees above had managed to dig their roots several meters into the rocks. aptly giving them the nickname &amp;lsquo;Rock Crushers&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/masaya-19.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were told it was unlikely we would see lava at the top but our guide had raised our hopes by saying the past two nights he had seen the glow of the lava which has been particularly rare since 2012. Luck was on our side as we emerged from the cave in the pitch dark to head back to the craters edge. Without a doubt we could see the orange glow of the lava that bubbled just below the surface of our feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/masaya-22.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really is difficult not to be impressed by these amazing acts of nature.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>San Juan Del Sur – Nicaragua’s Party Town </Title>
    <TitleURL>nicaragua/travel/san-juan-del-sur-nicaragua’s-party-town</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-09-25T01:52:14.53+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;San Juan is a beach resort on Nicaragua&amp;rsquo;s pacific coast. Like most resorts that border this sea it is popular with surfers. We have yet to acquire this skill but were drawing in by the prospect of cheap alcohol in Nicaragua&amp;rsquo;s most popular party town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beach is pretty enough and the town is nice, but by far the best thing about our stay was the amazing hostel we stayed in called Buenas Onda. Unlike other hostels which seem to be half-heartedly decorated this place has clearly had time and money spent on it feeling more like a hotel than a hostel. The views from the balcony were phenomenal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-juan-del-sur-1.jpg" alt="san juan de sur beach view"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We ended up staying 5 nights here because we loved this place so much. With a fridge full of beer at $1 each we couldn&amp;rsquo;t pass the opportunity to watch another sunset from this place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beach in San Juan does not actually have the best waves. Surfers are shipped from the town to other nearby beaches. This was not a problem for us as we had hours of fun playing in the small waves testing out our photography skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-juan-del-sur-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What cannot go unnoticed when backpacking around Nicaragua is the number of travellers wearing Sunday Funday Tshirts. This is a pool crawl around various different hostels organised every Sunday in San Juan. We had heard both great and terrible reviews about this event. Our plan was to attend but after partying a bit too much on Friday and Saturday we decided to give it a miss. Maybe we are just getting too old!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every day we said we would do the hike to the huge Jesus monument which stands proudly at the top of the hill at the end of the beach. Apparently this is the second largest in the world only being beaten by Christ the Redeemer in Rio. After 4 days of choosing beer and sunbathing instead of hiking we finally did make it to the top on our last day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-juan-del-sur-16.jpg" alt="san juan del sur view from statue"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Jesus statue was mediocre, but the views at the top were well worth the short but steep hike to the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After running up a ridiculously large beer tab we decided it was finally time to leave. We may not have done a lot with our time in San Juan but we certainly enjoyed ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;San Juan is a beach resort on Nicaragua&amp;rsquo;s pacific coast. Like most resorts that border this sea it is popular with surfers. We have yet to acquire this skill but were drawing in by the prospect of cheap alcohol in Nicaragua&amp;rsquo;s most popular party town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beach is pretty enough and the town is nice, but by far the best thing about our stay was the amazing hostel we sta...</ContentPreview>

    <Title>Isla Ometepe - Twin Volcano Island</Title>
    <TitleURL>nicaragua/travel/isla-ometepe-twin-volcano-island</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-09-28T00:39:05.1+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Isla Ometepe&amp;rsquo;s twin volcanic peaks rise majestically out of the surrounding lake. The narrow strip of land between them creates one island of rich fertile soil, volcanic beaches and a haven for wild life. There is something about Ometepe that draws you in looking for adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/ometepe-day-2-14.jpg" alt="Ometepe from ferry"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get to Ometepe you need to pass through Rivas then to San Jorge where there is regular boat and ferry services to the island. The main place to stay for travellers is Moyogalapa (where the ferry arrives). Based on recommendations we choose not to stay here and opted for Santa Domingo which is on the narrow land strip between the two islands. We figured this put us in a good location to explore both sides of the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Transport around the island is the only issue if wishing to stay further afield, taxis are very expensive and the bus service is infrequent. There are guesthouses, hotels and fincas along the road around the island but you need to know where you&amp;rsquo;re going beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get to Santa Domingo we took the bus to Altagrazia and then too Santa Domingo which took about 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Santa Domingo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Santa Domingo there is a lovely beach and not much else which suited us nicely. If you&amp;rsquo;re into bird spotting just sit back and relax the birds just come to you. We saw so many different kinds of birds it was amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Santa Domingo is isolated, to explore the island you really need your own transport. Luckily there is no shortage of vendors offering to rent you bicycles, scooters, motorbikes and quad bikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/ometepe-day-1-4.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the first day we hired a bike and explored the nearby sites. First we went in search of Petroglyphs near the hotel El Pourvenir. The Petroglyphs of which there are over 1700 are stone carvings left mysteriously on the island by the pre-Columbian civilisation that once lived here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/ometepe-day-1-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the afternoon we cycled north to find the fantastically beautiful Ojo De Agua which is a fresh water swimming pool built into a small river. This was much needed after a sweaty bike ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/ometepe-day-1-12.jpg" alt="swimming ojo de agua ometepe"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Around Ometepe&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the second day we wanted to explore further afield and the only way to do this was to hire some wheels. The safest and cheapest option for us was to hire a scooter. It&amp;rsquo;s questionable how safe they actually are. The usual stories of travellers crashing was confirme during the day when we&amp;nbsp;saw some people receiving medical attention after crashing thier&amp;nbsp;scooter. I have only ever driven a scooter once and that was 10 years ago in Thailand and was hoping not to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/ometepe-day-2-12.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning we set out around volcano Maderas. The paved road ended pretty soon and we were driving along dirt tracks through small villages and banana plantations. The population here live off the land, oxen pull ploughs through the fields and pigs, horses, cows and chickens wander around freely. The houses here are&amp;nbsp;humble and reveal a side of Nicaragua you are unlikely to see in the major tourist destinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/ometepe-day-2-5.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We planned to hike up the waterfall behind San Ramon or kayak down the Rio Istian&amp;nbsp;but decided exploring the island on the scooter was more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We turned back along the dirt road and went to Santa Cruz and stopped at El Zipotle Bus Shop for a cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/ometepe-day-2-10.jpg" alt="El Zipotle bus shop"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the afternoon we went to Magapolypa for lunch. The island of Ometepe is surprisingly big and it took nearly an hour to get there driving through village after village along paved road. The most dangerous things on the road were the cows that took no notice of traffic and stepped into the road without warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The few crazed barking dogs that&amp;nbsp;chased us out of the villages were easily shook off by speeding away! We spent the entire day riding around which was a great way to see the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people come here to hike the volcanos but it was an easy decision to give it a miss, the tops were almost always covered in cloud and we have climbed enough volcanoes on this trip already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had an amazing time just riding around and exploring the enchanting island of Ometepe.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Aventura -  Superman and Tarzan Swinging through Monteverde Cloud Forest</Title>
    <TitleURL>costarica/travel/aventura-superman-and-tarzan-swinging-through-monteverde-cloud-forest</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-10-01T23:39:30.65+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;We arrived in the lush cloud forests of Monteverde the weather here is cool and wet and it feels like home. It is a welcome relief from the tropical heat of Nicaragua. Unfortunately am unable to fully enjoy the change in climate as for some time, in the dark recesses of my mind, there has been a niggling worry. Monteverde is home to the biggest concentration of extreme sports in Central America meaning at some point I would have to participate in some form of adrenaline fuelled activities. Not so much because I really wanted to but because I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to look a fool in front of Leanne who claims snorkelling has the equivalent fear factor to her as jumping of a 295ft platform towards the ground does to me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/canopy-tour-8.jpg" alt="100% aventura tarzan swing"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many canopy tours to choose from, we chose 100% Aventura based on a good recommendation. It&amp;rsquo;s advertised that you will zip line through the cloud forest, cross rope bridges, fly on 2 &amp;lsquo;spectacular&amp;rsquo; superman style cables, rappel down ropes and experience the longest zip line in Latin America (1590m) finishing off with the stuff of my nightmares, a &amp;ldquo;Mega Tarzan Swing&amp;rdquo;. For someone who once had to bum shuffle down a spiral staircase in York Cathedral jumping off a 295ft platform is not on my everyday list of things to do. For Leanne however this was the deciding factor in choosing this tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/canopy-tour-4.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour begins with a demonstration off the guide where you met the rest of group. One of the guys in our group was an experienced &amp;ldquo;rock climber&amp;rdquo;, full of confidence, he had plenty of advice for us amateurs. When he double checked my harness it added a small amount of confidence to the little that was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few zip lines and rope bridges eased us into the swing of things. I was thankful that my fear of heights had dissipated in recent years. One thing Leanne was worried about was the fact that you had to brake yourself using one hand on the line behind you (you have a special glove on to do this) but there was never any issues with this as its really easy to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You then come to the rappel. Without really knowing what was happening I was reluctantly leaning out over the canopy and then dropped suddenly towards the floor with the tour guide at the bottom controlling everything. You are supposed to let go of the rope but I grabbed on for dear life getting some nice rope burns in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/canopy-tour-7.jpg" alt="aventura superman"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the rappel there is a small hike to the first superman zip line. This is the longest in Latin America and as the name would suggest you have to do it flying like superman. This is the point when people started to panic. However I was reserving all my fear for the &amp;ldquo;Mega Tarzan Swing&amp;rdquo; which was getting closer with each minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a moment it really felt like I was flying. The trees below whizzed past looking strangely like pieces of broccoli, it was a real bird&amp;rsquo;s eye view over the cloud forest, flying over trees and buildings at perhaps 60 or 70 km an hour. The whole experience lasted perhaps one and a half minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this was finished you were swiftly re-hooked onto another shorter zip wire to return. Arriving back at the other side I was asked &amp;ldquo;are you doing the Tarzan swing?&amp;rdquo; before I had a chance to say no he was preparing my harness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I followed the path towards the Tarzan swing several people were coming the other way having decided it would be better to go straight to the reception. There were a few people in the queue and the lady before me took her turn, walked to the end of platform and decided against it. Leanne then arrived and jumped ahead of me in the queue thinking that if she did it first I would have no choice but to follow. She walked out along the platform and jumped in complete silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I heard her shout &amp;ldquo;Karl you have to do it now&amp;rdquo; from below. Reluctantly I headed out along the platform becoming more and more frightened with each step. Somehow I made it to the end filled with fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I knew what was happening I was strapped in. I kept repeating &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not doing it&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going back&amp;rdquo; and the guide said &amp;ldquo;just say yes&amp;rdquo; so I say yes and he opens the gate. There was no need to jump as the rope pulls you out and you free fall for about 3 seconds before the Tarzan swing take effect. Leanne watched my fall from below and claimed I looked like I was trying to pull the rope through my hands trying to climb back up which she thought was hilarious. When it finally started to stop I was able let out a ridiculous scream as the adrenaline kicked in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fb-root"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We thoroughly enjoyed our day with 100% Adventura and would recommend it to anyone looking for fun and adrenaline. Even if you&amp;rsquo;re afraid it&amp;rsquo;s only natural so don&amp;rsquo;t let it put you off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the ever so confident &amp;ldquo;Rock Climber&amp;rdquo;, well he never even got passed the superman zip line but claims to have enjoyed the scenic walk back to reception.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Monteverde Cloud Forest Biological Reserve</Title>
    <TitleURL>costarica/travel/monteverde-cloud-forest-biological-reserve</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-10-02T00:08:47.477+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Monteverde Cloud Forest Biological Reserve is world famous. Home to over 100 species of mammals, over 400 species of birds, 120 amphibians and reptiles, tens of thousands of insects and over 3000 plants, including the largest orchid diversity in the world. Armed with these facts we set off early in the morning ready to spot some wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/monteverde-cloud-forrest-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only 3% of the reserve is open to tourists. These areas are marked out on clear trails. As we were visiting during the less popular rainy season not all of these were open but those that were still allowed us to fill 4-5 hours of walking. Although there may be a chance of it being a bit damper than usual visiting the park in the off season has the advantage of being a lot less crowded and on most of the trails it felt like we had the place to ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/monteverde-cloud-forrest-4.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this did not improve our animal spotting abilities. We did catch sight of a few birds, including some delicate hummingbirds and we spotted a few strange looking insects and some beautiful butterflies, including the grand Blue Morpho which is mesmerising to watch fly across the forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/blue-morpho.jpg" alt="Blue Morpho"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We may have failed to spot any of the 100 mammals (though Karl claims to have seen a squirrel) but we did enjoy the stunning forest scenery and diversity of the plants and trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/monteverde-cloud-forrest-19.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another highlight of the park is that it stands on the continental divide and at one of the lookout points it is possible to see both the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean. Unfortunately when we reached this point the clouds were too thick to see past a few feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/monteverde-cloud-forrest-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the lack of view and limited animal spotting the cloud forest did not disappoint. The trails through the trees are captivating. We may not be the next Attenborough but we certainly gained a new found appreciation for these rich and fragile ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>How to get from Nicaragua to Monteverde</Title>
    <TitleURL>nicaragua/travel/how-to-get-from-nicaragua-to-monteverde</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-10-02T20:39:53.297+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Our starting point was Isla Ometepe and our goal was to reach Monteverde in Costa Rica. There was very little information in the guidebooks or on the internet to indicate how this was done or even if it was possible at all. There only seemed to be a few blogs from guys who have ended up stranded in remote towns overnight. We didn&amp;rsquo;t want to end up stranded but the only other option which was well advertised was to get the Tica bus direct from Rivas to San Jose. Doing this would cost US$29 each and we would then have to stay overnight in San Jose and go back on ourselves to get up to Monteverde. This did not seem a practical option. So after 4 buses, a taxi and a ferry we did finally make it. Here is the route we used.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were staying in the small beachside town of Playa Santo Domingo on Island Ometepe when we began our journey. We started the day at 5.40am to get packed and ready to catch the 6am local bus from outside our Hostel, Hospedaje Buena Vista. Unfortunately this was not direct and we had to change at Altagracia to get the bus to the San Jose del Ser ferry terminal. This got us there just in time to catch the boat leaving at 7.20am. $1 for both buses was&amp;nbsp;much cheaper than getting the overpriced taxis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once off the ferry at San Jorge we jumped in a taxi to take us to the bus station in Rivas so we could then get the bus to the border. Obviously the taxi driver told us we would have to wait hours for the bus but could conveniently offer to drive us there for $20. We knew this was expensive but with little idea of how long the rest of the journey would take we decided to take this option and get to the boarder quickly. The journey takes 45 minutes and we think $15 would have been a more reasonable price to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once at the border it&amp;rsquo;s the usual chaos of people swarming around you offering advice and money changing. We were ushered by an official looking guy to a booth were we had to pay $1 each although we are not sure what this was for. Then we were told to fill in the usual departure forms and pay another $1.50 each to exit Nicaragua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On exiting the departure building it&amp;rsquo;s a 10 minute walk across to the Costa Rica immigration office. When we left there were two first class busses waiting, after speaking to a guy from the company NicaBus he said the easiest way to get to Monteverde would be to get the bus to to drop us off at&amp;nbsp;La Irma&amp;nbsp;and change bus there. It didn&amp;rsquo;t take us much convincing to pay the $12 each to get on the first class air conditioned coach. The other option, which we later found out from other travellers, was to walk across the boarder and get a local bus to from the border to Liberia, then change at Liberia to get to La Irma. This costs about $4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Entering Costa Rica is surprisingly easy. It is advised to have proof of onward travel to show to the immigration officer otherwise you may be forced to buy a bus ticket for $10 from outside the office. We had a flight out of Panama City booked so were planning to show that however we didn&amp;rsquo;t get asked. Although two guys in front of us did and they showed their flight itinerary on their laptop which the officer glanced at and let them through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whichever option you chose for getting the bus from the boarder you will end up being dropped off outside a petrol station in La Irma 37km from Monteverde which is a remote spot with very little around. Clearly, lost looking travellers are common as the friendly staff at the petrol station were keen to point out the red bus stop across the road which is where the bus to Monteverde will pick you up. Above the bus shelter it visibly points out that there are only two buses a day, one at 10am and one at 3pm. This was information the three tired looking travellers waiting at the bus station when we arrived had clearly not been given. They told us they arrived at 10.30 am and after several failed attempts at hitchhiking had been forced to accept they were going to have to wait four and a half hours or pay $20 each for a taxi. Due to their budgets they had decided to wait. After hearing their story we were less bothered about having to wait 1 hour 30 minutes as we arrived at 1.30pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon enough the bus stop was filled with travellers from various places and at 3pm the comfortable looking western style bus turned up to take us the final leg of the journey. The bus costs $1 and lasts for 1 hour. Driving up into the mountains was a fantastic way to end a tiring journey as the scenery was breath taking. After setting off from Santo Domingo at 6am we finally arrived at Monteverde at 4pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary the route we took from Niacragua to Monteverde is&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Starting at Isla Ometepe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Ferry to San Jorge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Taxi to Rivas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Border Crossing at Penas Blancas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Nica Bus to La Irma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Monteverde (Bus leaves La Irma at 3.00pm)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    <Title>The Secrets of Coffee at Don Juan Coffee Plantation</Title>
    <TitleURL>costarica/travel/the-secrets-of-coffee-at-don-juan-coffee-plantation</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-10-02T20:56:55.187+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Being British I have typically followed the stereotype of preferring a good cup of tea to coffee. Only choosing the latter on dark early mornings to get me up for work. However, after spending 3 months traveling around the coffee growing regions of Central America things have changed and black coffee has become a staple part of my diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking forward to learning more about this prevalent bean but had held off visiting other coffee plantations as the reviews on the internet highlight the Don Juan tour as being one of the best. On this tour you not only learn about coffee but also chocolate and sugar cane as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/don-juan-coffee-tour-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour begins in the garden where we learnt about the history of the coffee bean, its structure, and the process of growing the plant from seed. Our guide was brilliant, characteristically like the majority of Costa Ricans he was laidback and funny making the presentation much more interesting to listen to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/don-juan-coffee-tour-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On our way to see the fully grown plants we spotted a sloth sleeping in a tree. I was very excited as we had spent hours the previous day looking for this shy animal in Monteverde Reserve only to be disappointed. The enjoyment was short lived as while we were looking up at this animal an army of ants came to bite our feet forcing us to move on quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/don-juan-coffee-tour-5.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We then got to see some ripe fruits and were given a demonstration on how to pick them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/don-juan-coffee-tour-7.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are four layers which need to be removed before the coffee bean can be exposed. The next steps show the various traditional and modern machinery used to take off these layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/don-juan-coffee-tour-10.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/don-juan-coffee-tour-13.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After removing the initial layers it is time to dry the bean. The guide stresses that this is the most important part. He says it is incorrect to believe the quality of the coffee comes from the size of the bean or where it is grown. Big coffee beans are exported because they are ascetically pleasing and worth more, Costa Ricans keep the smaller beans for themselves but what they don&amp;rsquo;t tell you is they taste exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes a good quality coffee is it being dried correctly in the sun. This is more time consuming but will not stress the embrio inside the bean. Allowing it to retain all its flavour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/don-juan-coffee-tour-11.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally after the last layer is removed you have a coffee bean ready for roasting. Without knowing much about coffee I was led to believe that the darker, longer roasted coffee, which taste stronger and bitterer contained the most caffeine. This is incorrect and in fact the lighter the roast the more caffeine is retained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/don-juan-coffee-tour-24.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our guide passionately discourages us from drinking the extreme dark expresso roasts which he describes as burnt. He also tells us that this is actually used a lot by large commercial coffee chains as the taste requires consumers to add milk, sugars and syrups which allow them to add a premium onto the price. Good coffee should always be able to be drank black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the coffee we were took into what was described as &amp;rdquo;the happiness room&amp;rdquo; to learn about chocolate. We were firstly shown the raw cocoa beans which didn&amp;rsquo;t look particularly appetising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/don-juan-coffee-tour-25.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After explaining the extraction process our guide made us some traditional Mayan chocolate with vanilla, cayenne pepper and salt. It was delicious. We were then given a short demonstration about sugar cane where we took part in squeezing the juice for us to taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/don-juan-coffee-tour-28.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At long last we are given the chance to taste the coffee with light, medium and dark roast available. We sit enjoying the coffee overlooking the beautiful plantations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/don-juan-coffee-tour-32.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was an excellent tour and the result of the day is that we are now officially coffee snobs. Mines a sun dried, light roast, black, no milk and no sugar please.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Monteverde Butterfly Garden - Jardin de Mariposas</Title>
    <TitleURL>costarica/travel/monteverde-butterfly-garden-jardin-de-mariposas</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-10-02T21:04:01.067+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Having seen several butterflies around Monteverde, including the hugely impressive Blue Morpho, we were inspired to visit the butterfly gardens. The guided tour starts with insects and spiders, the first being this tarantula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/monteverde-butterfly-garden-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next our guide eagerly tells us that we are in luck as we get to witness a mother scorpion carrying her babies on her back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/monteverde-butterfly-garden-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We then got to hold some stick and leaf insects. My brief insect holding bravery is soon eclipsed as the guide puts a cockroach in her mouth. I however do manage to hold it but I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s going to be replacing the hamster any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/monteverde-butterfly-garden-5.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next we pay a visit to some seriously big and impressive beetles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/monteverde-butterfly-garden-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last stop on the insect tour is a cabinet contained a huge variety of butterfly chrysalis. Luckily a few butterflies have hatched and we are each given a butterfly to take to the gardens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/monteverde-butterfly-garden-9.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We then released the butterflies. My butterfly sat on my finger preparing for its first ever flight. Leanne panicked and dropped hers on the floor almost ending the butterfly&amp;rsquo;s life before it had a chance to fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/monteverde-butterfly-garden-13.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily no butterflies were damaged during the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/monteverde-butterfly-garden-15.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tour continued through three separate butterfly gardens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/monteverde-butterfly-garden-21.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The butterfly&amp;rsquo;s danced around us. The variety was amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/monteverde-butterfly-garden-22.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And we practiced some photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/monteverde-butterfly-garden-26.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We really enjoyed the butterfly garden and the guide was extremely enthusiastic and knowledgeable which really added to the experience.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Wildlife Hunting in the Dark at Santamarias Night Walk</Title>
    <TitleURL>costarica/travel/wildlife-hunting-in-the-dark-at-santamarias-night-walk</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-10-02T21:06:44.26+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;One of the things you can do when it gets dark in Monteverde is go on a night walk in search of the wildlife which are more active in the evenings. There are many options available and we choose Santamaria&amp;rsquo;s night walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/santamarias-nightwalk-15.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We turned up dressed for rain and were given torches by the guide who began by briefing us on the task ahead. To be honest we did not have great hopes of seeing anything after the lack of animals in the Monteverde Nature Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/santamarias-nightwalk-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a while we didnt find anything. Then the guide pointed out a tree which grows from the top of another tree downwards eventually strangling the host tree. Impressive, but not exactly the wildlife we were hoping for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/santamarias-nightwalk-3.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked a bit more and still didn&amp;rsquo;t see anything but it was still fun hunting around the forest with a flashlight in the dark. A bit further into the walk we see lots off insects, giant beetles, stick insects, leaf insects, grasshoppers and other tropical creepy crawlies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/santamarias-nightwalk-5.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were&amp;nbsp;then told to stop and turn off the torches to see fireflies and illuminous fungi. This was remarkable to see glowing in the dark forest. Just as we were beginning to think fungus and insects were the only thing we would be seeing we found a poisonous snake hanging from a tree waiting to attack passing prey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/santamarias-nightwalk-6.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we spotted the snake more and more animals began to appear. Next up were some raccoons which were spotted in a tree eating fruit. Their eyes glowing when the torch was shone on them. The two Americans we were with weren&amp;rsquo;t so impressed with the racoons so the guide quickly led us through the forest in search of a sloth which had been spotted in a tree holding its baby. This was the pinnacle of the tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/santamarias-nightwalk-14.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the way back we found two different species of Tarantula at the edge of their holes waiting for prey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/santamarias-nightwalk-16.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily tarantulas are not dangerous. When I got to close it ran for its life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking for wild animals meant that there was no guarantee of seeing anything on the walk so we were more than happy with what we had manage to spot in two hours. Although we could have seen nothing, having the opportunity to see animals in the wild is so much better than seeing them locked in a cage.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Monteverde Cheese Factory</Title>

    <DateCreated>2015-10-02T21:07:52.327+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;My guilty pleasure when it comes to food is definitely cheese. Nothing makes me happier than eating good cheese while drinking a glass of wine. The only person I know who loves cheese more than me is Karl. Whereas I try to refrain from consuming too much of this delicious, but highly calorific, dairy product Karl will eat blocks of it with little regard to his waist line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/monteverde-cheese-factory-1.jpg" alt="monteverde cheese factory front view"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So with this in mind we knew there was no need to debate whether or not we were going to be visiting the Monteverde cheese factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Costa Rica doesn&amp;rsquo;t exactly spring to mind when you think of cheese. In fact the factory in Monteverde was set up by a group of American Quaker families who emigrated from America in 1951 after being drafted to fight in the Korean war. Due to their beliefs they would not fight so had to leave the country or face time in prison. Costa Rica was chosen as their new home as they could purchase land cheaply and the country was safe due to having recently abolished its army.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/monteverde-cheese-factory-3.jpg" alt="monteverde cheese factory founding fathers plaque"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During our tour of the factory we were told the history of these Quakers and how they established the factory. For a long time the cheese factory was the biggest employer in Monteverde which is why it is a big part of their history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately three years ago, after being in financial difficulty, the families had to sell the company to a large multi-national.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were also shown the production floor and explained the process used for making the cheese. This is all very interesting but after an hour of talking we were ready to taste the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/monteverde-cheese-factory-9.jpg" alt="cheese factory floor"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were advised that the tastes of the cheese consumers in Costa Rica is slightly different to the European consumers as they tend to prefer a lighter tasting cheese. This becomes apparent when the first cheese we taste, the company's best seller, tastes like a soft cream cheese. After only being aged for 10 days it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of flavour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/monteverde-cheese-factory-14.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We then go on to try five other cheeses including, cheddar, Swiss, edam and parmesan. All of which are a lot milder than the varieties we would recognise in England. That&amp;rsquo;s not to say we didn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy eating them and we didn&amp;rsquo;t turn down second helpings when the tasting plates came round again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you come to Monteverde and don&amp;rsquo;t fancy the cheese factory tour you must at least try their ice-cream which is possibly the best I have ever tasted. After eating far too much dairy for one day we decide not to wait for the bus but to walk the 4 km back to our apartment.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;My guilty pleasure when it comes to food is definitely cheese. Nothing makes me happier than eating good cheese while drinking a glass of wine. The only person I know who loves cheese more than me is Karl. Whereas I try to refrain from consuming too much of this delicious, but highly calorific, dairy product Karl will eat blocks of it with little regard to his waist line.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>San Jose to Bocas del Toro via Puerto Viejo</Title>
    <TitleURL>costarica/travel/san-jose-to-bocas-del-toro-via-puerto-viejo</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-10-09T01:59:05.707+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;After a week in Monteverde we headed straight to the country&amp;rsquo;s capital San Jose. We have actively avoided most of the capital cities in Central America as there wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything that we wanted to see and they can be dangerous. San Jose is no exception, but it is smaller and more westernised, so with the prospect of air conditioned shopping centres to replenish some of our thread bear clothes we decided to stay for two nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our next destination that we wanted to go to was the top backpacker archipelago in Panama, Bocas del Toro. Although we had planned to speed through Costa Rica, as it is much more expensive than other countries, we did think it would be a shame to only visit two places so we decided to break up the journey to Boca with a two night stopover in Puerto Viejo De Talamanca.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Puerto Viejo is located on Costa Rica&amp;rsquo;s Caribbean coast and is close to the boarder with Panama. It is a laid back holiday spot with nice beaches and ample bars and restaurants pumping out a strange mix of reggae and salsa until the early hours. We spent a majority of our time in such bars and didn&amp;rsquo;t get to see much else, hence the lack of photographs. We could have stayed longer but we were keen to keep moving to reach our last Central American country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get to the boarder from Puerto Viejo. Local busses depart every hour to Sixoala at half past the hour and cost $3. The boarder itself was surprisingly quiet. You have to pay a $7 exit fee to leave Costa Rica. This can be paid by credit card in the immigration office or you can pay by cash at the shop outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once stamped out of Costa Rica you get to cross the bridge into Panama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/panama-costarica-bridge-border-1.jpg" alt="panama bridge"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the other side you are ushered to a booth to pay a $4 fee and get a sticker in your passport. We weren&amp;rsquo;t sure if this was a genuine fee or not but paid it anyway as they kept shouting about the police to us. Once on the bus we did get stopped by a police officer who checked for this sticker so we can only assume it was some sort of state tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are then pointed to the immigration office where you get your visa stamp. Here you will be asked to show proof of onward travel. Bus or flight tickets will do. We showed ours off our lap top. They also require you to have proof of $500 in your bank account. To do this they just asked to see our credit card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get to Boca from the border we decided to take the shuttle directly to the boat for $10pp, alternatively, you can take the local bus to Changuinola and then change to another bus at Almirante. The final leg of the journey by boat costs $7pp and takes approximately 30 minutes. Then, at last, we had arrived in the Panamanian paradise islands of Bocas del Torro.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Central American Beers</Title>
    <TitleURL>na/drink-reviews/central-american-beers</TitleURL>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brahva (Guatemala)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I liked this light watery, pretty standard Central America cerveza, enough to drink five litre bottles and miss the evening meal. Of course I woke up in the morning feeling hungry, sick and sorry for myself. Needless to say I never drank it again and opted for Gallo instead. Don&amp;rsquo;t let this be a reflection of the beer but of my own stupidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/brava-1.jpg" alt="brava beeer"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gallo (Guatemala)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The English translation of Gallo is rooster so it&amp;rsquo;s guaranteed to get you going cock a doodle do, but this rooster is Spanish so he says &amp;ldquo;qui qui ri qui&amp;rdquo;. This light pale lager beer comes in small bottles, litre bottles and a crazy 3 litre water cooler\keg with tap for pouring. This backpacker&amp;rsquo;s favourite is cheap, and fun. Unfortunately it lacks any flavour but that can be forgiven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/gallo-1.jpg" alt="gallo beer"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pilsener (El Salvador)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This enjoyable cerveza lager is made all the more pleasurable due to the fact that I had yet to be shot by any of El Salvadors gang members. It&amp;rsquo;s a thirst quenching light and watery drink if ever so slightly boring. Lacking in flavour it&amp;rsquo;s not special though it&amp;rsquo;s perfect for the hot climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/pilsner-elsalvador-1.jpg" alt="pilsner el salvador"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To&amp;ntilde;a (Nicaragua)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The local&amp;rsquo;s favourite beer in Nicaragua this golden lager style beer is light and slightly refreshing. It&amp;rsquo;s really not that good a beer but I really like it. Although it lacks in flavour it&amp;rsquo;s left some fantastic memories of a wonderful country. Is that not why we drink beer in the first place, simply to have a good time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/victoria-and-tona-1.jpg" alt="victoria and tona beer"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Victoria (Nicaragua) 4.9%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A favourite with tourists because of its ever slightly more European taste. This pilsen comes in a light and frost version as well. Anything with&amp;nbsp;the word &amp;ldquo;frost&amp;rdquo; in it is sure to go down well in this incredibly hot country, though this only refers to the microfiltration process not the fact it&amp;rsquo;s cold. Its golden, light, watery flavour tastes marginally better than To&amp;ntilde;a but lacks the feel good factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imperial (Costa Rica)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must have when in Costa Rica, if only because imported beers cost five times the price. As expected from Central America beer it&amp;rsquo;s light, pale, refreshing and inoffensive. Better than many in the region but not enough to stop me reaching for the litre of Flor De Cana rum purchased in Nicaragua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/imperial.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cerveza Panama (Panama)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tastes strangely like banana, perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s because there&amp;rsquo;s so many bananas around or was it just because&amp;nbsp;I ate a fried banana. Maybe this light and crisp beer really does taste&amp;nbsp;like banana but I will never find out as I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be trying it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/panama-cerveza-1.jpg" alt="panama cerveza"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cerveza Panama Light (Panama)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A lighter version of Cerveza Panama is probably good if you&amp;rsquo;re on a diet, not so good if you&amp;rsquo;re proud of your beer belly. Still has a banana taste, maybe I wasn&amp;rsquo;t making it up after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/panama-light-1.jpg" alt="panama light can"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balboa (Panama)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Named after the famous Rocky Balboa, well maybe not. This cerveza gets its name from Vasco N&amp;uacute;&amp;ntilde;ez de Balboa, a Spanish conquistador who established the first settlement in Panama in 1513. The beer is well packaged and well advertised, its light thirst quenching flavour goes down well in Panamas hot climate. Although preferred over Cerveza Panama, would I drink it back home, probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/balboa-1.jpg" alt="balboa two cans"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guiness Extra Stout &amp;ndash; 4.5% (Panama)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rekindled my love of beer, having spent too long in Central America I thought I had begun to stop liking beer. It&amp;rsquo;s not creamy like the Guinness in England, it quite watery but it&amp;rsquo;s seriously packed full of favour, you can taste the toasted barley and sweet malt, and it&amp;rsquo;s a real pleasure to drink. It&amp;rsquo;s perhaps the only beer in the Central American peninsula with an actual taste. Cleary it&amp;rsquo;s not a Central American brand but who cares it&amp;rsquo;s brewed locally and it&amp;rsquo;s at local prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/guinness-extra-stout-can-1.jpg" alt="guiness extra stout brewed in panama"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <DateCreated>2015-10-12T16:24:28.523+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Bocas Del Toro was once a secret paradise but is now Panamas number one vacation spot. This Caribbean Island archipelago is rated as the number one spot in Lonely Planet&amp;rsquo;s Central America guidebook. We came here looking for good times, sea, sand, and Caribbean sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We took the boat from the mainland not in a mass of glorious sunshine but rain. We headed to the Island of Colon and the popular tourist development of Bocas Town which is used by many tourists as a base for exploring the beaches of this tropical paradise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first area we wanted to explore was Boca Del Drago. To get there we hopped on a bus from Bocas Town, travelling 45km north, then took a boat to Playa Estrella (Starfish Beach).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/bocas-del-toro-4.jpg" alt="starfish beach"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Leanne sun bathed on pristine beaches I snorkelled amongst tropical fish and the biggest starfish we have ever witnessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/bocas-del-toro-17.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following day we took a tour with one of the local boatmen. First we went to dolphin bay where we once again were able to witness these magnificent creatures in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/bocas-del-toro-16.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next stop was what appeared to be the sloths very own Island. Hidden in the trees we could see several of these unusual creatures, surprisingly they were moving around, climbing, eating, and scratching their bums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=" /images/uploads/medium/bocas-del-toro-22.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What followed was both outstanding and comedic. We witnessed two sloths having a fight. As these creatures are notoriously slow it wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly thrilling, however watching them throwing punches in slow motion at the other was entertaining enough. Unfortunately, as we couldn&amp;rsquo;t stay all day, we weren&amp;rsquo;t able to see who came out on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/bocas-del-toro-23.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the waters here are not the best for snorkelling, as visibility is limited due to several rivers emptying silt into the archipelago, it&amp;rsquo;s still worthwhile and this was the next activities on the boat tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/bocas-del-toro-29.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the afternoon we arrived at Zapatillas Cayes which are two un-inhabited islands. Although when we arrive there was probably 100 or more other people there doing a similar boat tour. We found our own private paradise in the Corn Islands so are now more than willing to share. Once again we chilled on the beach and went snorkelling around the offshore reefs and underwater grass fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/bocas-del-toro-31.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final stop of the day was for some overpriced lunch on a restaurant on stilts. Mixed seafood was on the menu, lobster, fish, prawns and octopus. Leanne continued to get over her aversion to seafood and ate a prawn!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/bocas-del-toro-25.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We left the island the same way we came, wet and in the rain. After travelling in the rainy season for several months it&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe this has been the first time the rain has effected the trip but it certainly did not dampen our spirits! Bocas is one of the top destinations in Central America and we could have stayed longer to explore it more but we need to move on to our next stop, Panama City.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <DateCreated>2015-10-13T00:45:40.233+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Panama City was the last stop on our Central American adventure and marked the half way point of this journey. Thinking of Panama City inevitably conjured pictures of the famous canal and for me personally very little else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how wrong was I, after spending several months in Central America where the tallest buildings are three stories high the sheer size of Panama City comes as a shock. It can only be described as colossal in a region that is well known for lack of development and political turmoil. We haven&amp;rsquo;t seen anything like this since San Francisco and Vancouver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/panama-city-day1-21.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a city with a lot of money and investment, the canal has made this a hub of International business. The skyscrapers have grown up out of the once tropical jungle and the construction is continuing as they saying goes business is clearly booming!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/panama-city-day1-12.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We spent our first day walking along the sea front, the sun was shining and we made the most of the first world comforts all around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/panama-city-day1-3.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stopping to do some exercise on the sea front you could easily mistake this for Miami not Panama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/panama-city-day1-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the sea wall for an hour or so takes you to the old town known as Casco Viejo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/panama-city-day1-13.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original Panama city was founded in 1519 and was later sacked by the welsh pirate Henry Morgan, although these days he&amp;rsquo;s more famous for selling rum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The town was later moved in 1673 to Casco Viejo which is what we see today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/panama-city-day1-17.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a mixture of crumbling and renovated buildings, churches, museums, restaurants and bars. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely a must see tourist spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course there are&amp;nbsp;the Panama hat sellers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/panama-city-day1-16.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they were slightly out of our budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of our time in Panama City was spent spotting wildlife in the Metropolitan National Park and checking out Albrook mall which is claimed to be the biggest shopping mall in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panama city signalled the end our time in Central America, strangely, it didnt feel like the Central America we have grown to love but more like where we started.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;Panama City was the last stop on our Central American adventure and marked the half way point of this journey. Thinking of Panama City inevitably conjured pictures of the famous canal and for me personally very little else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how wrong was I, after spending several months in Central America where the tallest buildings are three stories high the sheer size of Panama City comes a...</ContentPreview>

    <Title>Panama Canal - Miraflores Locks</Title>
    <TitleURL>panama/travel/panama-canal-miraflores-locks</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-10-13T00:53:26.577+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;The canal is often the first thing to spring to people&amp;rsquo;s minds when Panama is mentioned. This is because the formation of this huge canal linking the Pacific Ocean with the Atlantic hoisted Panama to the centre stage for international trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/panama-canal-miraflores-23.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea of creating the canal was initiated by the Spanish in the early 16th century but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until 1880 when plans were put into action by the French. After financial troubles and disease caused the French to abandon the project it was finally completed by the United States in 1914. The US&amp;rsquo;s controversial sovereign rights to areas around the canal led to some tensions and in 1999 Panama took over full operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/panama-canal-miraflores-14.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The interoceanic waterway, stretching 80km from Panama on the Pacific side to Colon on the Atlantic, uses a system of locks with two lanes that operates as water elevators and raises the ships from sea level to the level of lake Gatun, 26 meters above sea level, to allow the crossing through the Continental Divide, and then lowers the ships to sea level on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is undoubtedly an impressive feat of human engineering and to see it in action was an amazing sight. We watched as an enormous Japanese car carrier passed though the Miraflores Locks which is home to the visitors centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the ship passed through the lock the captain blew the horn, the visitors waved and the ship crew waved back. Both the spectators and the ship&amp;rsquo;s crew took photos and cheered as both appeared to be equally impressed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/panama-canal-miraflores-1.jpg" alt="miraflores lock"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is a perfect example of human&amp;rsquo;s ability to cut and carve the planet to adapt to our ever increasing demands. In 2016 the second canal is due to be completed which will double the waterways capacity and allow larger ships to pass through. Currently many cargo ships are limited to the first canals width, this size limit is known as panamax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/panama-canal-miraflores-22.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard not to be concerned about the environmental and social impact of the canal. Although throughout the visitors centre we are constantly reassured that full impact studies have been carried out and mitigation measures have been put in place for reforestation and wildlife rescue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/panama-canal-miraflores-7.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People may have varying opinions on the canal but all we can say is that we thoroughly enjoyed our day at the Miraflores Locks and felt privileged to be able to see this amazing engineering project in action.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Being in the Caribbean Archipelago of Bocas Del Toro its only right that we indulge in some rum. The shops shelves are stacked high with Ron Abuelo Anejo so this seems the natural choice. My rusty Spanish translates this as Grandfathers rum.&amp;nbsp;It&amp;rsquo;s cheap enough, the small bottle we have purchased is only $2, after all, it&amp;rsquo;s a product of Panama so it should be cheaper than other rums. But is this going to effect the taste?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/abuelo-ron-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company Varela Hermanos has been making rums since 1908 and the 37.5% percentage is sure to add a few extra hairs on your chest. The rum is dark in colour and is &amp;ldquo;Reserva Especial&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;For this review we are going to first drink it straight and then try it mixed with coke. First for the unmixed glass, Leannes&amp;rsquo;s twisted face is not a good start. She says it tastes medicinal with a familiar smell of Savalon (an antiseptic spray).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dive in for my turn and initially is smells strong, which is all my untrained pallet can distinguish. I quite like it, it does taste medicinal but with a distinct oak after taste. When mixed with coke I would be happy to drink it all night, Leanne still maintains it doesn&amp;rsquo;t taste good but continues to drink it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We may have set our standards too high after the roaring success of Nicaragua&amp;rsquo;s Flor De Cana which is now the benchmark for all our rum tasting. Either way this is the cheapest drink around and after a few glasses who cares what it tastes like.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Panama City to Tenerife</Title>
    <TitleURL>spain/travel/panama-city-to-tenerife</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-10-27T20:44:01.777+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;The great beauty of long term travel is that no plan is ever set in stone, being spontaneous and following your instinct is all part of the fun. But what happened next we could never have predicted.&lt;br /&gt;For a start how does one end up flying from Panama City to Tenerife and then on the return flight land in Cartagena, Columbia. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure many people could claim to have done that, but air travel really has shrunk the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were invited to Regs&amp;rsquo;s 50th birthday party in Tenerife, which had been planned years in advance by Leanne&amp;rsquo;s mam, long before we even confirmed that we were going travelling. Of course we agreed but didn&amp;rsquo;t realise we would be on the other side of the world so abruptly cancelled the plan. Two and half weeks before and we were still not going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tenerife-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, we just happened to be heading to Panama City, the biggest airport in the area. We had also figured that we would have to either fly or sail to Cartagena, Columbia, as there are no roads connecting the two countries, just 70 miles of dense jungle known as the Darien Gap. Both options would be expensive so why not entertain the idea of making an extra stop in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what we did. Fly from Panama to Madrid, then Madrid to Tenerife. A journey from door to door of around 24 hours. Keeping with the Spanish theme of this trip it fits in well, except Tenerife was more English than England. Pints of beer, English breakfasts and lots of English people. It was like a holiday in a holiday and most importantly for us a chance to see family and friends. This was the ideal half way point break for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We kept it a surprise and when we turned up at the bar and asked Reg to get a round of drinks in, he was speechless and clearly shocked. It took him a few minutes to take it in but none the less got the beers in. And so started a great holiday, with plenty beers, food and good times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tenerife-15.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The journey back to Columbia was huge, 2 buses, 3 flights and 1 taxi. We fitted this all into one day, perhaps the longest day we have ever lived considering the day was 30 hours long. We left the hotel at 12.30am to take two buses to the north side of Tenerife, however the clocks went back an hour so we arrived an hour early. We flew to Madrid, changed flights and set off to Panama City and arrived 24 hours after setting off from Tenerife. A few hours wait at the airport trying to stay awake and short flight later we arrived at Cartagena. After a short taxi ride we made it to the hotel just before midnight on the same day. Along the way we gained 6 hours on our day making it officially our longest day without sleep! Tired and with what appeared to be a lack of sleep induced hangover we fell into a deep sleep ready to take on our South American adventure!&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Dorada –  Cerveza de Canarias</Title>
    <TitleURL>spain/drink-reviews/dorada-cerveza-de-canarias</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-10-27T20:51:55.063+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dorada&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/dorada-2.jpg" alt="dorada tenerife sunset"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Billed as the beer of the canaries this local beer is the top of my list, mainly because it&amp;rsquo;s cheaper as it&amp;rsquo;s brewed on the islands. In my eyes drinking the local beer makes the most sense. As I discovered a bit too late you can tour the Dorada factory on Tenerife, but I spent too much time actually drinking this beer to do the trip. Nearly everywhere in Tenerife sold this beer, well except some bars which appear to be just to &amp;ldquo;English&amp;rdquo; to do so. However that was made up by the fact Ricky Hatton was in the bar, riding the bucking bronco! It&amp;rsquo;s a great beer the only problem was that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t get you drunk, either it&amp;rsquo;s been watered down in the bars or I have a bigger alcohol tolerance in Europe. Four drinks in Colombia and I feel the same off eight pints of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tropical&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tropicalcerveza.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried this beer once in a bar that only sold Tropical, its green label is the opposite to Doradas bright red. Which is surprising considering they are made by the same company. In truth its not much different to Dorada but when your drinking 10 per night you really don&amp;rsquo;t care. Appears to me just another tactic by the big beer companies to flood the market with an alternative to those against the mainstream brands. But who cares it does the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Top Beer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/top-beer-3.jpg" alt="top beer"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheapest beer in the shop, the tin can weighs more than beer inside giving the impression you have a lot more left to drink. When it ends its surprising as the can still weighs the same as half a pint. Cheap, cheerful and has beer written in English, French (biere) and spanish (cerveza) on the front. Clearly a European favourite although I have never heard of it. Marks out of ten, two drinks and it&amp;rsquo;s gone. Like its name it&amp;rsquo;s a top drink before or after a night out as you get six of these for the price of a drink in a bar!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bonus Beer - Dorada Ice &amp;ndash; Guatemala&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/doradaice.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the name Dorada it reminded me of the Dorada Ice in Guatemala, the Guatemalan Dorada Ice is obviously more refreshing due to the &amp;ldquo;Ice&amp;rdquo;. This a similar kind of beer but the link is purely in the name. Dorada appears everywhere in spanish speaking countries, we have stayed in El Dorado, walked in El dorado and there&amp;rsquo;s a street in every city called el dorado. Curiosity tells me I need to find out what this means. It means &amp;ldquo;golden&amp;rdquo;. This beer is definitely golden, exactly the same as any cerveza. Great to have as a refreshing drink, great to drink loads with little regard of the taste, good enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dorada&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/dorada-2.jpg" alt="dorada tenerife sunset"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Cartagena - Gateway to South America</Title>
    <TitleURL>colombia/travel/cartagena-gateway-to-south-america</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-10-27T20:53:00.07+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Arriving in Colombia we did not know what to expect, many travellers we met along the way rate Colombia amongst their favourite countries. However those who watch the news may associate Colombia with fighting, hostage taking and cocaine and perhaps we did the same. It was soon time to leave these preconceptions at the door and our first taste of this country certainly was not one we were expecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/cartagena-15.jpg" alt="cartagena skyline"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cartagena was founded in 1533 and soon became the main port in the Caribbean as well as the gateway to South America. The city was plagued by pirate invasions the most famous being led the British &amp;lsquo;pirate&amp;rsquo; Sir Francis Drake. This led to the fortification of the town including a chain of forts and the wall. And this is where we started our tour of the city, just before sunset we walked around the ancient walls and along the sea front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/cartagena-5.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the walls lies the old town which is where we spent the evening. Little has changed here since the 16th and 17th centuries. Around every corner is a scene like a postcard back in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=" /images/uploads/medium/cartagena-31.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The architecture is worthy of any European city with plazas, balcony&amp;rsquo;s and tiled roofs this place has an amazing vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/cartagena-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s really not what we expected&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/cartagena-6.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent the rest of the evening drinking beer and watching local dancers in the leafy Plaza de Bolivar then headed to a beautiful restaurant where we had steak and drinks for only &amp;pound;10 per couple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/cartagena-12.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we headed to the Castillo De San Felipe. Work was begun on this fortress in 1639 and was completed 150 years later becoming the greatest fortress constructed by the Spanish in any of their colonies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/cartagena-14.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The owner of our hostel recommended the audio guides and they were really worth the money. There was little information inside the castle but we got the full history including the detailed accounts of attacks such as when the British were miserably defeated. The castle turned out to be truly unassailable and was never taken by anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/cartagena-20.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For us Cartagena was an amazing city and a real surprise. We are now looking forward to finding out what else Colombia has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;Arriving in Colombia we did not know what to expect, many travellers we met along the way rate Colombia amongst their favourite countries. However those who watch the news may associate Colombia with fighting, hostage taking and cocaine and perhaps we did the same. It was soon time to leave these preconceptions at the door and our first taste of this country certainly was not one we were expec...</ContentPreview>

    <Title>Tayrona National Park </Title>
    <TitleURL>colombia/travel/tayrona-national-park</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-11-04T13:00:07.317+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Reading back through some of our past blog posts I noticed that we tend to use the word paradise quite frequently. That is because we have been fortunate enough to spend a lot of time on the Caribbean coast which is renowned for its white sand beaches, turquoise waters and palm trees. While we have enjoyed these spots along out travels of Central America none can quite compare to what we experienced at Tayrona National Park on Columbia&amp;rsquo;s Caribbean Coast line. This place is truly a paradise like no other. As well as the typical Caribbean characteristics this park is also home to an abundant amount of wildlife, amazing forest scenery and waters that glimmer with gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tayrona-34.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t go thinking we had found our riches, the gold in these waters is fool&amp;rsquo;s gold so not worth the effort of panning through. Although, as the sun catches the small speckles in the water and the butterfly&amp;rsquo;s glide around it does feel like you have found a truly magical place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tayrona-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used the small fishing village of Tagananga as our base for entering the park. The hostels in the area will hold your luggage for you while you go off exploring. The park itself covers 12,000 hectares of land and 3,000 hectares of sea, along with the unspoiled beaches there are large areas of jungle which surround the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tayrona-15.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We caught the bus from Taganaga at 8am, arriving at the park just after 9. At the initial entrance visitors are asked to watch an information video about the park before they are allowed to purchase their ticket. You are required to show identification when entering the park so it&amp;rsquo;s important not to forget your passport. All bags are then searched for alcohol and drugs, as the police officer searched my bag he informed me with a smile &amp;ldquo;drogas son malas&amp;rdquo; (drugs are bad). Always good to know. &lt;br /&gt;We were then driven a further 10 minutes into the park where the trailheads begin. The beaches and campsites can only be reached by walking along the coastal trail which takes 1-2hrs. After being on the walk for less than 2 minutes we had already spotted our first wild animal, a small, but cautious looking, baby alligator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tayrona-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was shortly followed by some huge caterpillars and millipedes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tayrona-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scenery on the trail is spectacular but the heat can be a bit overwhelming. When we reached our first view of the beaches at the top of a cliff side it felt incredible to take in the scenery and catch much appreciated breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tayrona-5.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We spent much of our first day exploring the beaches and playing in the small areas of water which were safe to enter. The sea is notoriously dangerous along this coast and the undercurrents have killed around 100 tourists so far. As night fell and the mosquitos began to take over we headed back to our chosen campsite for a few beers and an early night. On our way we got a chance to see our neighbours, a group of tico monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tayrona-52.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately our dreams of a quite campsite were shattered when a game of dominos turned into a full blown party with very load Spanish music till the early hours of the morning. A few hours after the music was turned off it was the turn of the animals to wake us up. Insects, boars, monkeys, chickens and hundreds of birds all chipped in as our alarm clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tayrona-31.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We didn&amp;rsquo;t want to lie in anyway as there was still so much more of the park to explore. On our second day we decided to walk the scenic path inland, heading uphill to the pre Columbian town of Pueblito which still has areas of paths and foundations visible from this ancient settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tayrona-35.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The walk was more difficult than we had thought. Climbing continuously uphill and scrambling over boulders in the heat and humidity was a challenge but we got to see some fantastic wildlife including this brightly coloured salamander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tayrona-49.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it only took an hour and a half, reaching the top felt like an achievement. As we stood there, bright red, ringing the sweat out of our clothes we were passed by a group of Columbian school children who laughed at us as they walked past, bone dry, looking cheerful. The heat clearly doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect the locals the same as it does to us English folk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tayrona-41.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a short break we headed back along the trail back towards the entrance where we could pick up a bus to Taganaga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tayrona-46.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were lucky to have been able to enter the park as we found out when we arrived it was being shut down for the whole of November for the locals to carry out ceremonies and restore the park. It is a popular tourist attraction in Columbia but unlike other national parks we have been to the wildlife still seem to dominate the area, hopefully, with the will of the indigenous people, they will be able to maintain this. We would have to advise anyone wanting to visit the park to stay overnight to fully experience the area, yes you will get bitten by mosquitos, but these bites will only last a few days, the memories of this magical tropical nirvana will last a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Barichara – Canyons, countryside and eating fat bottomed ants</Title>
    <TitleURL>colombia/travel/barichara-canyons-countryside-and-eating-fat-bottomed-ants</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-11-04T13:42:50.69+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;From San Gil we took the local bus to the nearby picturesque town of Barichara. This quaint town is set high in the Mountains of Santander, with cobblestone streets, whitewashed buildings and red tiled roofs, it makes the perfect place for many photo opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/barichara-3.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The town itself is very small with few sites. One which can&amp;rsquo;t be missed is the grand Cathedral del la Inmaculada Concepcion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/barichara-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another is the surprisingly attractive graveyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/barichara-14.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing we wanted to do whilst in Barichara was to try the local delicacy hormigas culunas translating to, fat bottomed ants. These have been fried up by the locals for over 500 years as they believe they hold aphrodisiac and healing properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/barichara-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dived in first and after getting over the initial crutch, which cause me to squeal to the amusement of the locals, the taste reminded me of pork scratchings. Not too unpleasant but equally not moreish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/barichara-12.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karl tried to put off eating these critters claiming he wasn&amp;rsquo;t hungry but later caved in. In his opinion the taste was more like coffee and dirt. He liked the crunch but believed it more of an acquired taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/barichara-9.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picking ants out of our teeth we headed along el camino real to Guane. This 5k scenic walk was the perfect way to spend the afternoon. The climate is cooler up in the mountains so we were able to enjoy the sunny day and beautiful countryside at a leisurely pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/barichara-18.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As today seemed to be about trying new things we purchased a new exotic fruit to try, the Columbian granadilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/barichara-26.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the gooey green coloured centre doesn&amp;rsquo;t look appetising it tastes delicious and quite similar to passionfruit. We both decide we need to eat a lot of these while in Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/barichara-22.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the walk we reach the smaller town of Guane which looks like it has been placed there as a set for a movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/barichara-27.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We end our relaxing day playing pool and drinking beer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Days don&amp;rsquo;t get much better than this.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Aguardiente</Title>
    <TitleURL>colombia/drink-reviews/aguardiente</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-11-08T00:58:18.76+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Aguardiente or &amp;lsquo;fire water&amp;rsquo; to the locals is a traditional Colombian drink made of anise and sugar cane.&amp;nbsp;A 750ml bottle is approximately &amp;pound;5 and the brand we are trying is 29% alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/aguardiente-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell conjures images of drunken holidays in Greece as it has a smell not to dissimilar to Ouzo although when tasting it the aniseed taste is not as strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This drink is meant to be drank straight as shots but we don&amp;rsquo;t have a shot glass so its straight from the bottle for us. Leanne quivers at thought but in the name of research feels obliged to drink it, titling the bottle back she takes a big gulp and appears to regret doing so. She&amp;rsquo;s not a fan of aniseed, even disliking fennel due to its mild aniseed taste, however I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t turn down a shot of it in a bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/aguardiente-3.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I on the other hand love aniseed and this Agurdiente is really good. It&amp;rsquo;s not as strong as Ouzo which makes it more drinkable. If I was sensible enough to have a drinks cabinet I would have a bottle of this. It&amp;rsquo;s a perfect drink to share with friends and drink on a night out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/aguardiente-4.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this is what we did on the big Halloween night out in Taganaga, although this time we opted for the carton version which is exactly the same brand. Although it looks like it should be cheaper it&amp;rsquo;s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/agaudiente-carton-3.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difference is there&amp;rsquo;s no lid so when it&amp;rsquo;s opened it has to be drank. Fortunately, this wasn&amp;rsquo;t too much of problem for us.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Whitewater Rafting - San Gil</Title>
    <TitleURL>colombia/travel/whitewater-rafting-san-gil</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-11-08T02:16:25.933+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Located in the mountainous region of Santander San Gil has become the capital for adventure sports in Columbia. Paragliding, caving, abseiling, mountain biking and bungee jumping are all available but by far the most popular is white water rafting as tourists travel from far and wide to take on the unforgiving Rio Suarez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering I have never been fond of water I have spent a lot of time on this trip doing water based activities and rafting the Rio Suarez class 5 rapids has to be the most extreme yet. I did try and convince Karl that we should opt to do the tamer Rio Fonce which has class 1 to 3 rapids but this idea was shot down when the woman in the tour office described it as the baby run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/raftingsangil-(1).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After psyching myself up we headed off for our day of extreme rafting. Our guidebook advises that this river should be attempted only by experienced rafters. We have done rafting once before in Thailand but that was many years ago and only had one difficult section which was class 4. I certainly wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say this gave us any kind of expertise. When we met up with the rest of the group it seemed everyone was in the same boat (no pun intended) with only a couple of people having done it more than once or twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before going onto the water we were given a full safety briefing of what to do and what not to do whilst on the river. This included in-depth descriptions of how to react if thrown into the water in the middle of a rapid, what to do if the boat capsizes and what to do if you get stuck under the raft. This gave me a new range of scenarios to be afraid of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feeling sick I entered the water. We were given a short training session following the various commands then within minutes we were off down our first set of rapids. It didn&amp;rsquo;t take long for me to put the fear aside and enjoy the adrenalin pumping fun of being thrown around in the water. Each time we made it through a set of rapids the team cheered and I began to see what all the fuss was about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the first of the class 5 rapids the raft falls, spins and almost bends in half but we all say in. At the half way point our instructor gives us a chance to swim in the calmer section of the river. Then it&amp;rsquo;s back on board for the final half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last rapid was another class 5 and the two girls from the group in front of us fell out almost immediately. Listening intently to our instructor we followed and managed to power through. It was an extremely bumpy ride but we made it safely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both had a brilliant day and I was so glad I didn&amp;rsquo;t make Karl do the baby run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parque El Gallineral&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our last day in San Gil was a lot more relaxing. We spent the morning strolling through the local park. The trees are given a mystical characteristic as they are all draped in a moss called barbas de Viejo (old man&amp;rsquo;s beard).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-gil-5.jpg" alt="san gil park"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We found a few bright ginger squirrels, a poorly looking parrot and some enormous tree dwelling iguanas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/san-gil-9.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice alternative to the many life threatening activities on offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;Located in the mountainous region of Santander San Gil has become the capital for adventure sports in Columbia. Paragliding, caving, abseiling, mountain biking and bungee jumping are all available but by far the most popular is white water rafting as tourists travel from far and wide to take on the unforgiving Rio Suarez.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>48 Hours in Medellin - Murder Capital to Model City</Title>
    <TitleURL>colombia/travel/48-hours-in-medellin-murder-capital-to-model-city</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-11-11T00:25:13.427+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Medellin, the second largest city in Colombia is known as &amp;ldquo;the city of eternal spring&amp;rdquo; due its mild year round climate. Set in a narrow valley within the Colombian Andes the city skyline reaches for the heavens while the poorest neighbourhoods cling to the mountain sides. However, this forward thinking city has an undeniable past. Once the home of Pablo Escobar and the Medellin cartel towards the end of the 1980s this was the most violent city in the world. Today this forward thinking city is moving on and looking towards a brighter future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For our stay, like most travellers we opted to stay in El Poblado, this is the wealthiest district in the city and also the safest. It&amp;rsquo;s also close to the fantastically new modern metro system which gives access to the rest of the city. If you like to party there&amp;rsquo;s is great night life here, surprisingly there&amp;rsquo;s few salsa clubs with many opting for electronic dance music. The only problem is that our room appeared to be next door to a club playing techno music until three in the morning making it very difficult to sleep especially when it feels like your bed is in the middle of a club. The issue was short lived &amp;ldquo;if you can&amp;rsquo;t beat them join them&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/medellin-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting the next day later than usual we took the metro to the centre of the city disembarking at Botero Plaza. Before the day began the name Fernando Botero meant little to me but that was all to change. Medellin&amp;rsquo;s famous artist and sculptor is something of a local legend as well as an internationally famous artist. Botero plaza is a public sculpture park in the centre of the city which contains 23 of the artist&amp;rsquo;s sculptures all of which appear to be somewhat overweight. Many of his sculptures and artworks have been displayed in cities worldwide such Paris and New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/medellin-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We dive deeper into the Botero mania by visiting the adjacent Museum of Antioquia, more of an art gallery than museum this houses more of his works including many of his famous paintings. It turns out the characters that make up his art or not actually fat they are &amp;ldquo;volumous&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/medellin-10.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the museum contains modern art, gradually becoming a little too modern for us so we make a dash out of the building. Passing through the crowded city we head to Bolivar Park to check out the local craft market where hunger kicks in and we head to a local restaurant for something to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/medellin-13.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We always like to try the local dishes after trying ants in the Santander region it couldn&amp;rsquo;t really be any worse. The most famous dish in the Antioquia region is called Bandeja Paisa. The origins of this dish are said to have begun with the poor farmers of the area who ate it as a single high calorie meal that would last them all day while they worked. What came out was monstrous in size and consisted of Rice, Beans, Fried Egg, Steak, Pork Rind, Salad, Chorizo, Avocado and Arepas (corn cake). It was hardly a problem for my big appetite but however delicious it may be I won&amp;rsquo;t be eating this highly calorific food every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/medellin-15.jpg" alt="Bandeja Paisa"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we were so close to Parque Lleras, the main spot for nightlife, it made sense that we went out to see what was on offer in this vibrant city. Experiencing the &amp;ldquo;La Fiesta Paisa&amp;rdquo; is the main reason many people visit this city and we weren&amp;rsquo;t going to miss out on the fun. The huge selection of bars, clubs and night clubs rivalled any modern city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following morning feeling hungover we took the metro and changed on to the world class Metro Cable. This is more ski lift than a metro and was designed to connect some of the poorest districts to the city. Previously residents would have to walk 2 and half hours to get to work, many words of thank you are painted on the roofs of the houses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/medellin-day-2-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cable car silently takes you over the undeveloped and sprawling houses giving an interesting perspective on this part of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/medellin-day-2-12.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing on the second cable car for 20 minutes takes you out of the valley and over forest to a national park with a small farmers market full of delicious food to help cure our hangover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/medellin-day-2-5.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Medellin was a real surprise for us, it&amp;rsquo;s modern, vibrant and forward thinking but tomorrow we are going to look into the darker side of this city but we will leave that for the next post.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Finding Pablo Escobar in Medellin</Title>
    <TitleURL>colombia/travel/finding-pablo-escobar-in-medellin</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-11-14T15:36:57.88+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Behind Medellin&amp;rsquo;s new image is a dark history of cocaine, extreme violence, power and wealth. One man in particular created the biggest drugs empire the world has ever known, Pablo Escobar is a name that many relate not just with Medellin but with Colombia. Today we go in search of the truth about what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/pablo-portrait.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two company&amp;rsquo;s running Pablo Escobar tours, on one you get to meet Pablo&amp;rsquo;s brother Roberto and the other which drives you around the city stopping at various spots. We opted for the latter not really wanting to give any more money to the Escobar family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our tour guide for the day, a young Colombian women is very sombre about the subject of Pablo Escobar which is not surprising considering five of her uncles where killed during the violence. The people of Medellin feel the same way with nearly everyone having a story to tell of someone close losing their life. Most choose to forget the past and Pablo as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we drive around the city in the cramped mini bus our tour guide, speaking through a microphone fills us in with the facts. The first stop is the Monaco building, one of Escobar&amp;rsquo;s 800 properties, and famous as the scene of the first car bombing which was planted by Escobar&amp;rsquo;s rivals, the Cali cartel, in a bid try and kill Escobar and his immediate family. Though Escobar survived his daughter still suffers hearing problems from the blast today. The building itself is fenced off and you can&amp;rsquo;t enter the compound. Like many of Escobar&amp;rsquo;s former residences it is owned by the government and has remained empty ever since being repossessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/pablo-escobar-tour-3.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Monaco Building Bombing was the start of hundreds of car bombs in the city and the next stop which happened to be next to our hotel was the scene of another car bomb. Though now there is little sign if the devastation as the building has been restored and is now a restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we drove around the city the guide told us many horrific stories, one such example was the rituals performed with dead members of the cartel. When a cartel member was killed they would be dressed up and sun glasses would be placed on their face. The cartel members would then carry them around the bars and clubs on one final drinking session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/images/uploads/medium/escobar-money.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We continued on passing more buildings either funded by Pablo or owned by Pablo, there was more white buildings built in what is known as the &amp;lsquo;Narco Architecture&amp;rsquo;, white Miami style buildings surrounded by palm trees. There are football stadiums built by Pablo and multiple&amp;nbsp;shopping centres built with drug money. As the bus slows the guide informs us we are safe as we enter into one of the poorest neighbourhoods which has been devastated by the production of cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it&amp;rsquo;s not the cocaine itself that&amp;rsquo;s destroying this neighbourhood it&amp;rsquo;s the by-product. When cocaine is made there is a paste left at the bottom of the barrel in Colombia it&amp;rsquo;s referred to as Basuco. Said to be more potent than crack cocaine it is smoked either with tobacco or in a pipe and we are told that 1 gram costs 1000 pesos (less than 25p). With some users smoking up to 100 grams a day this stuff is destroying people&amp;rsquo;s lives, this is a direct effect of the wests greed for cocaine. We are told that some travellers get &amp;lsquo;lost&amp;rsquo; in this neighbourhood and don&amp;rsquo;t return home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bus continues for a while and in a leafy middle class neighbourhood we all get out the bus and look across the road, the small non-descript building was Pablo&amp;rsquo;s final hiding place. This is where he was finally discovered hiding with his sole remaining body guard Limon. Although now it has been refurbished and another floor added it hardly looks like it belongs to one of history&amp;rsquo;s most violent stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/pablo-escobar-tour-5.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Around the back of the building is the roof top where Pablo was shot trying to escape, who actually killed him is lost in time, with every group involved claiming the kill. The DEA, PEPES, the Colombian army all say they took the final shot, while the Escobar family claim he killed himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/pablo-escobar-tour-6.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final stop on the tour was the grave of Pablo Escobar. The grave yard is simple and the rules state that the graves must be flat and modest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/pablo-escobar-tour-9.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, even in death Escobar managed to cheat the system. His grave is lavish compared to the others, it&amp;rsquo;s surrounded with his favourite palm trees and it&amp;rsquo;s always adorned with fresh flowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/pablo-escobar-tour-13.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we stand by the grave it&amp;rsquo;s hard to appreciate someone who killed thousands, we are told as many as 33,000 people lost their lives in Medellin, he indiscriminately killed anyone in his way, judges, politicians, policemen (600 where killed in Medellin) and even presidential candidates. He even brought down a passenger jet in the hope of killing one person who did not even board the plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the bizarre after effects of Escobar&amp;rsquo;s reign of terror is that Colombia now has one of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest populations of wild hippo. After Escobar&amp;rsquo;s luxury estate Hacienda Naples, a 20km2 estate with several mansions, bull fighting ring, go kart track, airport, four lakes, life size dinosaurs and a zoo, the government was left with the task of re-homing the animals. There was two hippos in the zoo, a male and a female. The government was unable to find a way to transport them so decided it was best to &amp;lsquo;forgot&amp;rsquo; about them. Now there is a population of 40 hippos wandering around the estate. Hacienda Naples has recently been turned into a theme park but we did not visit it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with the death of the big cartels Colombia is producing and exporting more cocaine than ever, in smaller networks with small groups handling each process it&amp;rsquo;s impossible for the government to track them down. Even now its clear there is a lot of cocaine in Medellin, seemingly everyone wants to sell it to you for less than a pint of beer. The tour guide states it costs no more than 20,000 peso for a gram which is about &amp;pound;4. She then finishes with an emotional speech saying that to stop the cocaine production people in the west should stop taking it but that won&amp;rsquo;t happen, it&amp;rsquo;s clear the war on drugs is not working (look at Mexico, El-Salvador, Honduras) and to stop the suffering the only way forward is education and regulation. A point in which I agree but in reality is unlikely to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;Behind Medellin&amp;rsquo;s new image is a dark history of cocaine, extreme violence, power and wealth. One man in particular created the biggest drugs empire the world has ever known, Pablo Escobar is a name that many relate not just with Medellin but with Colombia.

    <Title>Manizales – Coffee, Craters and Coca Tea</Title>
    <TitleURL>colombia/travel/manizales-coffee-craters-and-coca-tea</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-11-14T15:45:36.437+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Heading south we decided to make a stop in Manizales. This city itself is nothing special although, as is the theme with most Latin American cities, it does have an impressive church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manizales-16.jpg" alt="manizales church"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the surrounding area that holds the real delights. One of the main reasons people stay here is to visit one of the many coffee plantations which cover the landscape. Even though we had done a coffee tour in Costa Rica we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to miss out on visiting one of Columbia&amp;rsquo;s most famous exports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hacienda Venecia Coffee Farm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our visit to Hacienda Venecia took us out of the chaotic city into the lush green mountains where were greeted off the bus with a steaming hot freshly brewed roast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manizales-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour was different to the one we had experienced before. Our guide went into more detail about the different markets for coffee and the various different blends available. We were then took on a hike through the plantation where we were given a taster of what it would be like to work in the fields. I don&amp;rsquo;t think any of us are now aspiring coffee pickers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manizales-7.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scale of the plantation was much bigger than we had seen before and with year round harvests the place was full of activity. We got to see the machinery in action, pealing and sorting the beans, while people ran around grabbing bags to fill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manizales-9.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We learnt a lot of information specific to the Columbian market. We had previously heard that coffee in Columbia was awful as all the best quality beans get exported. This is true, the reason is that there are strict rules which govern Columbia saying that they are not allowed to export any low quality coffee so producers can only sell to the local market. Obviously everything else they produce gets exported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manizales-13.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a traditional lunch and several cups of coffee we were allowed to explore the beautiful grounds and kick back in a hammock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parque Nacional Natural Los Nevados&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another striking feature of this region is the snow-capped volcanos which serve as our first taste of the Andes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manizales-22.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were two options available from Manizales, one involved an 8 hour hike to the summit of Nevado de Santa Isabel, at 5100 meters above sea level this is a difficult trek, alternatively you can opt to be chauffer driven around to the Nevado del Ruiz crater. Vividly remembering our previous volcano hiking experiences we chose to go for the easy option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manizales-34.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the visit we got to see another side of this diverse country. The scenery from the mountains is outstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got to see some of the countries unique flora and fauna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manizales-31.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then delved into the ghost like world at the top of the volcano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manizales-46.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevada del Ruiz is still active and some areas were cordoned off due to continuous seismic activity. In 1985 the volcano erupted killing more than 20,000 people. This recent harrowing event casts an even darker shadow over the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manizales-40.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As well as being the most destructive it is also the highest volcano in this chain reaching up to 5,321 meters. Driving up to the crater the effects of the altitude begin to kick in. The guide stops at a road side stall where we are given Coca tea to ease the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manizales-25.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Made from the same leaf that produces the powerful illegal drug cocaine we were disappointed to find that the teas stimulating effects were less than that off a cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our day ended at some thermal pools, which was an excellent way to warm up after freezing at the top of the volcano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manizales-52.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although we spent most of the day in the van the trip turned out to be better than expected. This was partially helped by having a good group of people on the tour who turned our bus into a party bus pumping dance tunes from Latin America between each stop.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;Heading south we decided to make a stop in Manizales. This city itself is nothing special although, as is the theme with most Latin American cities, it does have an impressive church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/manizales-16.jpg" alt="manizales church"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the surrounding area that holds the real delights. One of the main reasons people stay her...</ContentPreview>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Self-proclaimed Salsa capital of the world and ranked &lt;a href="http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/most-dangerous-cities-in-the-world.html" target="_blank"&gt;9th most dangerous city in the world&lt;/a&gt;. In 2012 it was ranked the 4th most dangerous city so there has been some improvement. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe that the same article also states that our home Newcastle is the 3rd most dangerous city in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/cali-view.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We checked in to Cali as it was a short 5 hour bus ride away from Manizales and were sick of overnight bus journeys. We found neither murder nor salsa in Colombia&amp;rsquo;s 3rd largest city. Principally because we didn&amp;rsquo;t go looking for either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are both clearly not salsa dancers, the few lessons we took in Mexico helped prove the point, so we skipped the salsa clubs and headed for the colonial, bohemian neighbourhood of San Antonio where we joined the friendly locals chilling in the park below the Chapel of San Antonio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/cali-chapel.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drinking beers from the second floor of an expensive restaurant with live music we could see the city lights sprawling across the distance. It was hard to think that Cali was such a dangerous place. But a few drinks later and some food we decided to be safe and call it a night ready to continue our southward journey in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Settled between Colombia&amp;rsquo;s Andean peaks this old colonial city is for a lot of travellers the last stop on the way to Ecuador, for us it&amp;rsquo;s a break in the journey on our way to see Colombia&amp;rsquo;s number one archaeological site San Agustin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/popayan-3.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t take long to walk around the colonial town centre, its clean white washed buildings and many churches are a testament to the long history of this place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/popayan-11.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walking to the top of a nearby hill we mingle with the locals and take in the views of the town, following the back route down we check out the local artisan market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/popayan-5.jpg" alt="popyan view"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a few hours we have seen most of what the town has to offer so we decide to book a downhill biking tour. We hoped to be driven to some thermal hot springs in the mountains outside of town and then bike the 30km back to down. What we didn&amp;rsquo;t realise was the following day was a national holiday. Not surprisingly the driver didn&amp;rsquo;t show up claiming that his van was broken, the two other drivers didn&amp;rsquo;t answer their phone. Clearly the driver pulled a sick day but who can blame him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With very little else to do we enjoyed the 50p beers in the hostel and headed out to enjoy Popayan&amp;rsquo;s great selection of new food restaurants. With the exception of the incredibly large portions of grilled meat and exotic fruits Colombian food is incredibly bland and we were not expecting much. The local Italians fantastic lasagne dish more than met expectations but perhaps the huge jar of accompanying red wine had something to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning we woke up early with a sore head and made the bumpy bus ride along cold mountain roads in search of San Augustin.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Secrets of the Ancient Statues of San Agustin</Title>
    <TitleURL>colombia/travel/secrets-of-the-ancient-statues-of-san-agustin</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-11-23T13:13:11.413+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;The ancient civilisations which inhabited the lands around San Agustin are shrouded in mystery. Very little is known about these people apart from what can be depicted from the many statues which have been found in the area. After being overwhelmed with archaeological sites in Mexico we had enough of a break for our enthusiasm to be regained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another motivating factor was the surrounding countryside, with green rolling hills filled with sugar cane and coffee plantations it&amp;rsquo;s not a bad place to spend a few days. We decide that an interesting way to take in the views and visit a few of the sites would be to hire a horse. Karl had never been on a horse before and I had only done it a handful of times when I was much younger and much less afraid of spinal injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanaugustin-1-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our guide arrived in the morning with our two stallions, we mounted, and then were let loose. Neither of us had much control over the animals. Karl&amp;rsquo;s horse had some apprehensions, being afraid of dogs, cows and cars and preferring to walk backwards than forwards. Mine had no fear which was good when the pack of savage dogs tried to attack us but not so good when he decided he wanted to trot ahead away from everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanaugustin-18.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We got to visit three of the sites on our horse ride, Pelota and El Purutal still had colour intact from over two centuries ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanaugustin-7.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also got to see the impressive La Chaquira which is carved into the mountain overlooking the stunning Rio Magdalena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanaugustin-15.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After our mornings ride we spent the afternoon loosening off our legs at the archaeological park. The well maintained grounds contain a large majority of the statues found in the area. Walking around these strange anthropomorphic carvings allowed our imagination to wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanaugustin-29.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When reading about this ancient civilisation I was pleased to find out that archaeologists believe they treated men and women equally as there are a number of statues depicting women rulers. However, they also performed human sacrifices. So maybe they weren&amp;rsquo;t prefect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanaugustin-26.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our second day was spent on a jeep tour which took us to the more difficult to reach areas. We got to see more statues as well as some beautiful waterfalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanaugustin-48.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And we took an interesting detour to a sugar factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanaugustin-38.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge 2kg block of sugar cane are sold all over Columbia. These industrial size blocks could be bought for &amp;pound;1 each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanaugustin-41.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jeep was a fun way to get around the area although by the end of the day we were all covered in a thick layer of dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had a fantastic time in San Agustin and we have to give a shout out to our wonderful host Ceasr at Hostel Hooaka &amp;ndash;ya who welcomed us like we were family. His passion for Columbia and his hospitality knew no bounds. Plus, he made the best cup of freshly roasted coffee we have tasted so far.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>The Mystery of Tierradentro</Title>
    <TitleURL>colombia/travel/the-mystery-of-tierradentro</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-11-24T14:56:19.377+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;h3&gt;Getting To Tierradentro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting to Tierradentro was half the fun if that&amp;rsquo;s what you want to call it. From San Agustin it takes three bus rides and can be done in five hours. When the hostel owner told us this we foolishly thought he was referring to an actual bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However we were in a remote region of Colombia, it was far enough from the laws of civilisation that we were asked if we wanted to go on a tour of a cocaine factory and watch it being produced. Sensibly we turned the offer down. Unlike the rest of Colombia there are less police and of course less tarmacked roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out our &amp;lsquo;bus&amp;rsquo; was more of a jeep\pick-up truck. Less comfortable than a bus but way more exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tierrodentro-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first stop took us from San Agustin to Pitalito and took around 45 minutes, the driver took us behind the bus station where we were swiftly transferred to another truck. So far the journey was going perfectly. The onward journey to La Plata took us through lush mountain scenery and small farming villages, the view from the back of the truck was superb though the winding dirt roads made me feel a little nauseous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tierrodentro-24.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four hours later we got off the truck in what appear to be someone&amp;rsquo;s back yard, this in fact was the bus station at La Plata. Five minutes later another truck pulled in but we didn&amp;rsquo;t know that it was the one we need to get to Tierradentro. It turned out you needed to take the truck to San Andres and you would be dropped off on the way. While we were figuring this out a mass of people had descended on the truck. The back seats were full, the sides were coated in people hanging on, and some brave souls were sitting on the roof amongst the luggage. It turned out that we too had to find a place to attach ourselves to the vehicle as the next bus was three hours later. I might have enjoyed sitting on the roof but there was no room for the two of us. Nor was there room for a lot of other people who like us had to find something else to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tierrodentro-3.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walking around the main square it looked like there was very little in La Plata to do or see and nowhere to stay if we couldn&amp;rsquo;t catch the next truck. Several guys offered to give us a ride on the back of their motorcycles but we hired the services of a local taxi driver to take us the rest of the way. At 90000 pesos it was more expensive but was worth the extra cost of waiting and fighting to get on the truck. Around an hour and a half later across rough terrain we arrived in a tiny village near to the entrance of Tierradentro Archaeological Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tierradentro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arriving at Tierrodentro we checked into a basic but perfectly suited guesthouse and settled in for the night. After our home cooked meal we went for a walk but didn&amp;rsquo;t get very far as the village consisted of only a few houses and beyond that we were surrounded by darkness. Life is very different there, with most people working the land for a living it&amp;rsquo;s a stark contrast to life in the Colombian cities so with little to do we returned to the guesthouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning we headed to the archaeological park, after a quick look in the museums we started up the mountains and out of the valley to begin a 14km walk. The fresh morning air was soon replaced by a strangling heat as we headed upwards to the site of the first tombs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tierrodentro-23.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten minutes uphill walking and we were out of breath but soon made it to the first archaeological site. Each tomb was sealed with a wooden trapdoor. We opened the first hatch and descended down the stairs, each step down a step back in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tierrodentro-4.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few of the tombs still have colours inside revealing a glimpse into the mysterious society that created them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tierrodentro-12.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we looked inside the tombs we wondered of the civilisation that created them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tierrodentro-17.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tombs are thought to have been built in the 6th to 9th century. Little is known about the culture that built them which adds to the mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tierrodentro-15.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amongst other things the tombs comtained pots which were used as urns to store the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tierrodentro-7.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We continue onwards up the hill where&amp;nbsp;another set of tombs awaited us, then it was on to the tiny village of San Andreas. Along a dirt road we passed by small farms, observing the local population growing fruits and drying coffee outside their small houses built with mud, bamboo and other locally available materials, whilst chickens, cows and horses wandered around freely. We even spotted someone growing cannabis plants outside their house. Compared to urban Colombia it was like a window into a past time except it very much exists in the 21th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tierrodentro-22.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch in San Andreas we continued the walk up the mountains on the other side of the valley, dropping in a few more tombs on the way although excitement had worn off by then. The path continued back to the entrance of the park and we made our way back to the guesthouse before dark with a new friend who refused to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tierrodentro-26.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting Away - Tierrodento to Bogota.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we came to pay the bill it only costed &amp;pound;25 for the two nights stay, two evening meals each, breakfasts and 12 beers. Despite the difficulty getting there it was hardly expensive on the wallet.&lt;br /&gt;Fully expecting a nightmare journey we awoke early and at 6.30am we were waiting in the fresh and misty mountain air outside the guesthouse for a passing truck heading to La Plata. As it approached we flagged it down but it was clearly full and people were already sitting on the roof, however this time we were prepared to find a space no matter what. Leanne hung on for 10 minutes but then a small old lady, conveniently the size of Leanne, got off so she squeezed into her space. I suddenly saw the advantages of being small. Looking into the truck I knew at least two of these petite people would have to get out before I stood any chance of getting seat, therefore, I resigned myself to the fact that I would be clinging on for the full hour and a half. Leanne kept reminding me not to let go but this was such a fun way to travel that I soon forgot how unsafe it could have been hanging onto the back of a truck going 60mph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An hour and a half later over winding mountain roads and gorgeous valleys we were surprised to be dropped off at a modern bus station, and we wondered how we had missed this on the way in. With direct buses to Bogota we waited happy in the thought that we did not have to take any more trucks during the 9 hour journey to civilisation that lay ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;h3&gt;Getting To Tierradentro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting to Tierradentro was half the fun if that&amp;rsquo;s what you want to call it. From San Agustin it takes three bus rides and can be done in five hours. When the hostel owner told us this we foolishly thought he was referring to an actual bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However we were in a remote region of Colombia, it was far enough from the laws of civilisation...</ContentPreview>

    <Title>Chicha</Title>
    <TitleURL>colombia/drink-reviews/chicha</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-11-24T23:06:51.53+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Chicha is a traditional drink made by the indigenous people in Columbia. Derived from maize it can be made in either a fermented or a non-fermented version. We first encountered this beverage whilst on a walking tour of Bogota as our local guide insisted we buy some to try. It is sold by Chicheros in half litre glass bottles and we bought 2 for our group of 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/chicha-1.jpg" alt="chicha bottles"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main ingredients for the drink are corn and panela which are traditionally combined in a clay pot. Panela is a hard brown sugar cane which is very popular throughout Columbia. Cinnamon and water is added to the pot and the mixture is brought to the boil and then simmered for an hour. After that it is allowed to cool then placed in a fridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longer the drink is allowed to ferment the stronger the alcohol content will be. Ours had only been fermenting a few days so was about 2% alcohol. Unfortunately Karl&amp;rsquo;s allergy to maize meant he was unable to try it but he did have a smell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/chicha-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is strongly advised not to smell the drink before drinking it as it smells like rotten fruits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drink has a thick consistency, slowly edging its way into the glass rather than pouring in. Our group does the compulsory &amp;ldquo;salud&amp;rdquo; then we all begin to taste. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t any immediate sounds of delight. Once you get over the strange consistency there is very little taste then the minute you gulp it down you are hit with the tartness from the fermentation which hits you at the back of your teeth. In my opinion this isn&amp;rsquo;t very pleasant. Some people in the group think it is alright and others don&amp;rsquo;t like it at all. I&amp;rsquo;m unsure so go for a second glass but on finishing it I don&amp;rsquo;t go rushing for another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is an interesting local drink that should be tried at least once when passing through Columbia but it won&amp;rsquo;t be one I will be making back at home.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Bogota - Capital of Colombia</Title>
    <TitleURL>colombia/travel/bogota-capital-of-colombia</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-11-24T23:19:06.96+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Bogota is a city with a turbulent past. Being the capital of Colombia it has received attacks from various political groups, guerillas and drug gangs. One of the most famous attacks destroyed the ministry of justice building, thought to be carried out by M-19, funded by Pablo, this theory is now being questioned as new investigations show it may have actually been orchestrated by the army itself. This type of conspiracy talk is common in Colombia. All the locals we have spoken to stress how corrupt the political system is and state how damaging it is for a country which is rich in resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/bogota-19.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We decided to start our visit to Bogota with a walking tour of the city. Walking tours can sometimes be quite dull but our lively Colombian guide kept us entertained throughout. We were taken to try some of the local dishes including the fermented drink &lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/colombia/drink-reviews/chicha/" target="_blank"&gt;Chicha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/bogota-35.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were also taken to an excellent coffee house where our guide explained about a government led programme to train barristers. Through educating the locals about coffee they have created an up-and-coming coffee culture where the Colombian&amp;rsquo;s now understand the value of their export. As well as the coffee we also got to try the unusual mixture of hot chocolate and cheese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/bogota-9.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had seen this a few time throughout our travels but this was the first time we got to taste it. We have to admit it was quite good. Although that may be because the cheese was very light in flavour. It may not have worked so well with a stilton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other delights we sampled were waffles with jam and toffee and the extremely popular corn snack arepes which were dripping with cheese and butter. It goes without saying that Colombian food isn&amp;rsquo;t the healthiest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/bogota-20.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the tour we were taken to a bar to play a local game of Tejo which involves throwing metal weights at packets of gun powder. It&amp;rsquo;s a fun game but I could envision the chaos erupting after one too many drinks. Of course Karl hit the gun powder on his first shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is loads to do in the city and with only two days we had to be selective as to what we wanted to see so the next day we opted to go to the sparklingly new gold museum and the highly recommended police museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The museum de oro was dazzling. The endless rows of gold ornaments and jewellery was mesmerising to see. The displays also included information about the ancient processes used to make the pieces as well as some impressive light and sound shows which emphasised the importance of a lot of items that were used in religious ceremonies. It&amp;rsquo;s obvious why the Spanish spent so much time looking for gold in South America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/bogota-gold-museum-47.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the afternoon we went to the police museum. We learnt that in Colombia all men aged 18 have to do one year mandatory service. The young man taking us around the museum was clearly pleased with his placement and although he was very proud of working in the police force he did tell us that he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be continuing after his one year was up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/bogota-28.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pablo's money counting machine and desk used to store money&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our guide enthusiastically talked about the criminals they have prosecuted over the years including the notorious leader of FARC and of course Pablo and his motley crew. Aswell as his Harley Davidson, Raybans and video camera, strangely they have a piece of the roof from where Pablo was shot on display which, as our guide was a bit too keen to point out, still showed some of his blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/bogota-33.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bogota was our last true Colombian city before we head into the Amazon and like most of our stops in this country it was another diverse and fascinating place to visit.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;Bogota is a city with a turbulent past. Being the capital of Colombia it has received attacks from various political groups, guerillas and drug gangs.

    <Title>Gateway to the Amazon - Leticia</Title>
    <TitleURL>colombia/travel/gateway-to-the-amazon-leticia</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-12-03T00:40:36.957+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Leticia is located deep in the Colombian jungle, inaccessible by road, this riverside town, often known as the triple frontier, is at the meeting of three borders, Colombia, Brazil and Peru. This was to be our entry into the amazon basin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/amazon-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flying into the city was a superb way of seeing the enormity of the jungle which stretched for miles and miles as we approached Letitia. Flying from Bogota, with its cool breezy climate, made the change in weather all the more dramatic as we stepped off the plane into 40 degree heat with thick moist humidity. Finding a hostel with a cool pool to jump into was a necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/amazon-15.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the advice of the hostel owner we were sent into the local park for sunset. We climbed to the top of the church tower and were able to witness the influx of 30,000 Canary-Winged Parakeets sweep into the trees to nest. Literally thousands of these brightly coloured birds filled the sky. With the air chilling and the sun setting over the amazon it was a picturesque way to be introduced to this spectacular environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/amazon-3.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending a day relaxing by the pool and getting our visas and onward travel sorted we wanted to go deeper into the jungle to see what else was on offer. The recommended option is to go on a 3-4 day tour however with the boat leaving in two days we were forced to take the more basic and touristic one day tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/amazon-7.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one day boat tour makes several stops along the river, the first was at Monkey Island where you are greeted by loads of small monkeys. These cute looking creatures use the flocks of tourists entering their home as climbing frames, jumping from one person to another they propel themselves from various parts of your body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/images/uploads/medium/amazon-29.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was so much fun and hilarious watching Karl getting shit on by one of these mischievous animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/amazon-22.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next we were taken to a visit a local tribe. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t great as it all seemed to be a bit of a tourist show. While a boy wearing a costume with a two foot penis attached showed us his moves, I was forced to dance by a child in a strange evil looking outfit. I stood on his bare feet a few times so I have probably been cursed now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/amazon-39.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had lunch in the car free town of Puerto Nari&amp;ntilde;o which had some excellent views of the river and lakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/amazon-45.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At end the day we were taken to an animal &amp;ldquo;sanctuary&amp;rdquo;. This was basically a wooden shelter filled with some weird and wonderful creatures. A lot of them were babies. I can only hope that they weren&amp;rsquo;t stolen from their mothers only to be cast out into the wild again when they are longer cute enough for the tourists and are unable to defend for themselves. Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m clearly never going to be an animal rights activist as these thoughts soon melted away when I got to hold the baby sloth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/amazon-62.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How adorable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/amazon-65.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are still unsure what some of the animals are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/amazon-73.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boat arrived back at sunset and we got yet another spectacular sunset photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/amazon-79.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trip may not have been the wild trekking adventure we had hoped for but with four days on a boat to Manaus to look forward to we knew we were going to see plenty more of the amazon river.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>The Amazon River – Slow Boat from Leticia to Manaus</Title>
    <TitleURL>brazil/travel/the-amazon-river-slow-boat-from-leticia-to-manaus</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-12-04T17:47:32.41+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;This was not something I was looking forward to. Karl had got it into his head that the best way for us to enter Brazil from Columbia was to take a slow boat along the amazon for 4 days from Leticia. That&amp;rsquo;s 3 nights and 4 full days sleeping in a hammock, on a boat filled with people in a humid tropical climate. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too keen on the idea as my legs are a patchwork of scars from mosquito bites, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t thrilled with the idea of openly lying there as bait for them in a hammock. So I made a mental list of the positives; it was cheap, I was pretty sure I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t die, Karl really wanted to do it, and I could add it to my list of character building experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/amazon-86.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to say that all my negative thoughts were totally wrong. The boat was great. Maybe it was because my expectations were so low that I was easily pleased, but whatever the case, it worked and I had a great time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it was cramped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/amazon-103.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it did get hot during the day, but as long as the boat was moving we got a nice refreshing breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were toilets and showers, which although weren&amp;rsquo;t glamorous, were regularly cleaned. We got 3 meals a day included. The food was ok, a few people got sick, but I was fine and ate pretty much everything they served. There was even a roof top deck area with a bar. There were quite a few fellow gringos taking the boat so we could all group together to drink rum and play cards to pass the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/amazon-112.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not too bad at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/amazon-94.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, the ultimate plus point, not one single mosquito bite!! Obviously, I had failed to think about how these insects sent by the devil would actually manage to get onto the moving boat. I had envisioned swarms coming out of the trees at night. But no, no swarms ever came. I actually think it&amp;rsquo;s one of the longest periods I have went in Central/South America without getting bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hammocks were comfortable enough. Karl liked his so much I had to practically peal him out of it to get him off the boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/amazon-102.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey was certainly much more pleasant than expected. However, it is boring and after the initial excitement of being on the amazon all you see is trees, trees and more trees. Don&amp;rsquo;t go expecting to see wildlife swinging from the riverside branches. In the whole 4 days all we saw were, dolphins, beetles and a leaf insect which we adopted as a temporary pet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/amazon-109.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a great experience, although you do need to take a good book and plenty of rum to pass the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/amazon-117.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when&amp;nbsp;we arrived in Manaus we were shocked to find out so much time had passed it was nearly christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Unexpected Rio De Janeiro</Title>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Rio De Janeiro, the city of sunshine, sand and samba. We were pretty sure we knew what to expect after seeing many photos of Copacabana beach, where the beautiful people go to strut their stuff, with one hand on their popped out hip, and the other holding an ice cold caipirinha. Well, as it turns out, we can&amp;rsquo;t have our own way all the time. When we arrive it&amp;rsquo;s the city of unseasonal rain, the so called El Nino effect has made it feel more like England than the tropical paradise we had anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/rio-de-janiro-58.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly we aren&amp;rsquo;t going to be spending our time here sunbathing. The high cost of transport in Brazil makes a big dent in our budget and cities can be notoriously expensive so we decide to take the offer of a free walking tour of the Downtown and Lapa districts. We visited the posh coffee shop Confeitaria once frequented by two British icons; the queen of England, and one of our travel idols, the legendary, Michael Palin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/rio-de-janiro-3.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was followed by a trip through history as we entered the old Palace of the king of Portugal, built when he moved his court to Brazil during the Napoleonic wars. The tour took us past many famous buildings including the ornate theatre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/rio-de-janiro-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And concluded at the world famous Selaron steps, created over a life time by Chilean artist Jorge Selaron the steps are built from tiles from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/rio-de-janiro-12.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately we didn&amp;rsquo;t spot any from England, the closeset we found was a tile depicting wales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/rio-de-janiro-15.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily we were gifted one sunny day and decided to make the most of the blue sky to visit Christ the Redeemer. Toted as one of the seven wonders of the modern world the giant statue of Christ is symbolic of Rio De Janeiro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/rio-de-janiro-36.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several ways to get to the famous statue. The first is to take a train to the top of the mountain, the second is to take a mini bus and the final option is to walk. I persuaded Leanne to walk, climb, and at some points scramble, to the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/rio-de-janiro-18.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This turned out to be beneficial for a number of reasons. 1. It was free, 2. It was quicker than waiting 3 hours in a queue to get the train. 3. It was fun 4. It was hilarious when Leanne nearly crapped herself at the sight of a snake waiting in the middle of the path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/rio-de-janiro-28.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We also spotted a toucan and some monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/rio-de-janiro-23.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reaching the summit we walked into the land of selfie sticks, bum bags and immaculately dressed people. We suddenly became conscious that we were covered in mud and sweat. Most people evidently took the easy route! But not to miss out we elbowed through the mass of people to pose for the obligatory shot with the big man himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/rio-de-janiro-44.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking to the top made the day worth it, there was no waiting around and we felt like we had achieved something. For those people who don&amp;rsquo;t want to exert any energy there is also an escalator for the final 200 steps from the end of the road to the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/rio-de-janiro-45.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the seven wonders the Statue of Christ is my least favourite. It&amp;rsquo;s just a statue of Jesus and it is not as big as I imagined, the Angel of the North is probably bigger. But what really is mind blowing is the view of Rio Janeiro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/rio-de-janiro-34.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/rio-de-janiro-35.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Night out in Lapa&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a beach party wasn&amp;rsquo;t looking likely we decided that joining a pub crawl would be a good idea to meet other people and see the city. We visited two pubs and two clubs. As you enter the clubs you are given a card which you use to pay for everything in the club, you are then expected to pay for everything on the way out. Somehow I can&amp;rsquo;t see that working in England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/rio-de-janiro-46.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to prove a point that the world is smaller than you think the host for the pub crawl had spent a year living in Northumberland, England. If you&amp;rsquo;re from Northumberland like us you might know where Otterburn is but it&amp;rsquo;s just as likely that you don&amp;rsquo;t. It&amp;rsquo;s a tiny village in the heart of Northumberland and is a strange place to be talking about with a Brazilian in Rio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/rio-de-janiro-55.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stocking up on cheap drink before the tour might of made us feel ten years younger at the time but the next day our true ages showed, unable to get out of bed until 2pm the rest of the day was a write off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the weather forecast still looking gloomy we decide to move on from Rio in search of sunnier climates.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Finding the national drink of Brazil was not difficult. Walking around the bars of Rio this drink can been seen on almost every table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/rio-de-janiro-52.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The name, pronounced &amp;ldquo;Kai-Pee-Reen-Ya&amp;rdquo;, can affectionately be said to mean &amp;ldquo;little countryside drink&amp;rdquo; or less affectionately as &amp;ldquo;a drink for the hillbillies&amp;rdquo;. Some say the drink originally included garlic and was a remedy for a cold or flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cocktail is made with Cachaca (Brazilian sugar cane rum), lime and sugar. To prepare the drink the limes are sliced in to quarters and then placed in a sturdy glass before being bashed with a wooden utensil to realise the juices and oils. Ice is added to the glass along with generous quantities of Cachaca and sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/rio-de-janiro-47.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s it! It&amp;rsquo;s a simple and refreshing cocktail that is guaranteed to have you shaking your hips after a few glasses.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Iguazu Falls – The waterfall to beat all waterfalls </Title>
    <TitleURL>brazil/travel/iguazu-falls-the-waterfall-to-beat-all-waterfalls</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-12-17T20:14:55.74+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;We left Rio with a 23 hour bus journey ahead of us, unfortunately this turned into a 27 hour journey as our bus broke down half way. Needless to say we were pleased when we arrived at the border city of Foz do Iguazu.&amp;nbsp;Brazil shares the cities two major attractions with its neighbours. The star of the show is the natural wonder, Iguazu falls, which straddles both Brazil and Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/igassu-falls-6.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We visited Iguazu falls from the Brazilian side first. It is highly recommended to visit from both countries as each offer a different perspective of the falls. Arriving at the Brazilian entrance feels like walking into a theme park. You are guided onto a tour bus which takes you from the park entrance to the water. Along the way you stop at different locations offering scenic walks, boat tours and rafting experiences, all of which are an added extra to the ticket price. We stick to the main attraction and head straight for the falls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/igassu-falls-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stepping off the bus you hear the roaring sound of the water crashing into the rocks. We run down the path eager to catch our first glimpse and are instantly stunned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you travel you get used to seeing waterfalls. Yes, they are usually very pleasing to look at and they are almost always guaranteed to be set in beautiful scenery, but after a while they all become very similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/igassu-falls-9.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is not one of these waterfalls. If we put all the waterfalls we had ever seen together it would only cover a fraction of the size of Iguazu. Standing 80 meters high and 2,700 meters in diameter this is truly an awe inspiring site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/igassu-falls-7.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We follow the path along the edge of the river until we reach a section which is built into the area of falls known as devils throat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/igassu-falls-17.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking up at the volume of water teeming over the edge makes you revaluate how powerful water actually is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/igassu-falls-27.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As memorising as it is to watch we are soon soaking wet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/igassu-falls-24.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were impressed with what we saw but having only seen a small section we understand why it is necessary to visit the Argentinian side in order to appreciate the full scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/igassu-falls-29.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Argentinian side the setup is different. There is a train which takes you to the top of the devils throat where the platform guides you out into the water, right at the edge of these powerful falls. It is both impressive and unnerving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/igasu-argentina-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/igasu-argentina-9.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the top you are unable to see the walkway which we had stood at on the Brazilian side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/igasu-argentina-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a number of trails through the falls providing optimum views from all angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/igasu-argentina-12.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paths over the water tend to be quite narrow and can get crowded so once we had enough off trying to barge past the dawdler&amp;rsquo;s we swiftly headed to the exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/igasu-argentina-18.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Traveling is its most rewarding when you see something which is so breath-taking that no matter how many photos you take none will quite compare to seeing it first-hand. Iguazu falls is one of these places and certainly a highlight of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>A Sneak Peak into Paraguay</Title>
    <TitleURL>paraguay/travel/a-sneak-peak-into-paraguay</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-12-17T20:23:42.063+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Our plans to visit Paraguay went out the window when we had to wait in Foz Do Igasu so that Leanne could have dental work done. Although we never really made it into the heart of Paraguay we did technically go twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Itaipu Dam&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/itaipu-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We decided to break up the visit to the falls with a trip to Itaipu dam. After visiting Hoover dam in America I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting to be too impressed, but I was wrong. Only surpassed in size by the Three Gorges Dam in China, Itaipu makes the hoover dam looks like a miniature model compared to this concreate beast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/itaipu-4.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spanning the border of Brazil and Paraguay the dam was named one of the seven wonders of the modern world by the American Society of civil engineers and it&amp;rsquo;s not hard to see why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/itaipu-22.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tour takes you around the dam on a bus and the guide explains some facts and figures about the construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/itaipu-15.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;To obtain the same amount of energy generated per day you would have to burn 536,000 barrels of petroleum per day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;The pace of work during construction was equivalent to building one 20 story building every 55 minutes and it took 18 years to build.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;The amount of earth excavated is equivalent to that of 8.5 Eurotunnels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;The maximum height of the dam is that of a 65 storey building.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;The spillway supports a flow 40 times greater than that of Iguazu falls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;The iron and steel used in construction would build 380 Eifel towers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;The dam generate 85% of Paraguay&amp;rsquo;s national energy consumption and 15% of Brazils.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What surprisied us most is that we had never even heard of this place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ciudad Del Este&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the river from Foz do Igasu is the city of Cuidad del Este, Paraguay&amp;rsquo;s second largest city. Its primary purpose is to sell cheap goods to the tourists that visit the Brazilian side. We had no trouble getting across the border, freely crossing without even being asked for our passport. The only issue was torrential rain and the fact that it was Sunday and 99% of the shops were shut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/ciduad-del-este-rain-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we did what Brits do best when the situation gets bad and it rains, go for a drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/ciduad-del-este-rain-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drinking Stella Artois in a shopping centre felt as Paraguayan as a red double decker bus.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>A Uruguayan Christmas - Punta Del Diablo</Title>
    <TitleURL>uruguay/travel/a-uruguayan-christmas-punta-del-diablo</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-12-28T19:26:21.987+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;The once sleepy fishing village of Punta Del Diablo, with its vast unspoilt beaches and dirt tracks is fast becoming a tourist hotspot. This remote part of Uruguay was to be our home for the Christmas period. Even though the summer had begun all of the Argentinian and Uruguayan tourists that flock here in January and February were at home celebrating Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/punta-del-diablo-21.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Punta Del Diablo was still quiet except for a few people building popup beach side bars ready for the 30,000 or more visitors expected to arrive after Christmas. All this meant we had the choice of many discounted rooms as it was still officially the off season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/punta-del-diablo-25.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting to Punta Del Diablo from Buenas Aires did not take too long when taking into account the scale of South America. Taking the Colonia Express Ferry from Buenas Aires to Colonia was a straightforward procedure, the company even organised a direct transfer to Montevideo which was waiting for us as soon as we stepped off the ferry. Five hours after setting off from Buenas Aires we arrived in Montevideo at the Tres Cruzes Terminal where it was a further five hour bus ride to Punta Del Diablo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/punta-del-diablo-14.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reasons beyond comprehension the bus drops you off way outside of town. There&amp;rsquo;s only one taxi servicing the whole village and when we arrive it looks like he has already been booked. We did manage to get a lift in a shared van but then it was still another thirty minute walk to the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/punta-del-diablo-126.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arriving at the apartment we were pleased to see it had all the amenities we could ever wish for, our own fully equipped kitchen, swimming pool, balcony and roof top terrace and best of all it was only a five minute walk to the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/punta-del-diablo-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/punta-del-diablo-30.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Christmas Eve&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christmas Eve was spent exploring the amazing beaches around Punta Del Diablo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/punta-del-diablo-27.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small fishing houses added to the beautiful landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/punta-del-diablo-12.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The sand dunes and cold wavy sea reminded us of home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/punta-del-diablo-99.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christmas in Uruguay is traditionally celebrated on the night of the 24th so we were invited to a BBQ at one of the hostels. We clearly weren&amp;rsquo;t going to be having turkey this year, this is a land where cow is king and every field we passed was full of herds grazing. BBQ beef or asadas as there known here are a way of life which is not surprising as the beef here is some of the best in the world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/punta-del-diablo-44.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we spent the night drinking Caipirinhas and feasting on meat, salad and sweet potatoes whilst trying to make conversation in Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/punta-del-diablo-50.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was followed by a late night Christmas bonfire until the early hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/punta-del-diablo-55.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Christmas Day&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is ever a day when you miss home Christmas day is the one, but we couldn&amp;rsquo;t exactly complain waking up with the sun shining and the beach and sea within view. The hangover was quickly soothed with a Christmas morning bucks fizz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then off to the beach to drink beers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/punta-del-diablo-82.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Christmas dinner, not surprisingly, consisted of beef. 1KG of beef tenderloin which would of cost a small fortune in England cost only &amp;pound;5. Trying to make some resemblance to an English Christmas dinner we cooked roast potatoes, carrots and onions. The plan went out the window and we simply ate them fresh from the oven on the roof top terrace with a bottle of amazing Uruguay Tannot (red wine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/punta-del-diablo-109.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not you&amp;rsquo;re typical Christmas day but then again nothing this year has been ordinary.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;The once sleepy fishing village of Punta Del Diablo, with its vast unspoilt beaches and dirt tracks is fast becoming a tourist hotspot. This remote part of Uruguay was to be our home for the Christmas period.

    <Title>The Best of 2015</Title>
    <TitleURL>na/travel/the-best-of-2015</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-12-29T13:26:02.827+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Another year is over and without a doubt this has been one the best years of our lives. Its been a difficult task but we have managed to pick out a few of our top&amp;nbsp;moments of 2015. Having passed through 16 countries and spent 243 days on the road 2015 has been one long adventure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/nicaragua/travel/a-caribbean-getaway-on-the-corn-islands/" target="_blank"&gt;The paradise moment &amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;The Corn Islands, Nicaragua&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This little known island 80km of the coast of Nicaragua is&amp;nbsp;the perfect place to chill and find a deserted beach all of your own!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/nicaragua/travel/a-caribbean-getaway-on-the-corn-islands/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/best-of-2015-(3).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/guatemala/world-history/tikal-and-flores-visiting-the-greatest-ancient-mayan-city/" target="_blank"&gt;The historic moment &amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;Tikal, Guatemala&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far the most majestic of all the ancient Mayan cities we have visited. Tikal is huge, well preserved and set against the backdrop of the Guatemalan jungle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/guatemala/world-history/tikal-and-flores-visiting-the-greatest-ancient-mayan-city/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/best-of-2015-(16).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The runners up were.....&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/mexico/world-history/palenque-the-ancient-city/" target="_blank"&gt;Palenque, Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/mexico/travel/teotihuacan-the-place-where-the-gods-were-created/" target="_blank"&gt;Teotihuacan, Mexico&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/usa/travel/honey-i%27v-left-the-car-keys-in-the-grand-canyon/" target="_blank"&gt;The "Oh my god are you serious!" moment &amp;ndash; Leaving the car keys in the Grand Canyon, &lt;em&gt;USA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending all day hiking into and then out of the Grand Canyon only to realise that you have left your cars keys at the bottom is quite possibly&amp;nbsp;the stupidest thing you can do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/usa/travel/honey-i%27v-left-the-car-keys-in-the-grand-canyon/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/best-of-2015-(5).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/mexico/travel/swimming-with-whales-sharks-and-turtles-on-isla-holbox/" target="_blank"&gt;The fishiest moment, &lt;em&gt;Isla Holbox, Mexico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swimming with whale sharks and turtles. Watching dolphins, flamingos and flying fish in pristine Caribbean waters and finishing the day drinking beers while the sun sets. Perfect!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/mexico/travel/swimming-with-whales-sharks-and-turtles-on-isla-holbox/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/best-of-2015-(7).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/mexico/travel/swimming-with-whales-sharks-and-turtles-on-isla-holbox/" target="_blank"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/nicaragua/travel/revolution-and-culture-in-leon/" target="_blank"&gt;The most political moment &amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;Talking with revolutionaries in Leon, Nicaragua&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The museum was not so special but it is ran by Nicaragua's revolutionary fighters who are real life living history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/nicaragua/travel/revolution-and-culture-in-leon/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/best-of-2015-(8).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/category/el-mirador/" target="_blank"&gt;The sweatiest moment &amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;Five day jungle hike to the ancient city of El Mirador, Guatemala&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trekking through miles of untamed Guatemalan jungle, the destination the long lost city of EL Mirador, this ancient city captures the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/category/el-mirador/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/best-of-2015-(4).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/colombia/travel/whitewater-rafting-san-gil/" target="_blank"&gt;The most adrenaline pumping moment - White water rafting, &lt;em&gt;San Gil, Colombia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rio Suarez is no lazy river, grade four and five rapids&amp;nbsp;make this white water river an&amp;nbsp;adrenaline fuelled ride of a life time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/colombia/travel/whitewater-rafting-san-gil/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/best-of-2015-(14).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/usa/travel/escaping-death-in-death-valley/" target="_blank"&gt;Finding the perfect detour moment &amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt; Death Valley National Park, USA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A snow storm covered Yosemite National Park so we opted to go somewhere much warmer. The amazing landscapes made Death Valley a place to remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/usa/travel/escaping-death-in-death-valley/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/best-of-2015-(12).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/usa/travel/escaping-death-in-death-valley/" target="_blank"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/brazil/travel/iguazu-falls-the-waterfall-to-beat-all-waterfalls/" target="_blank"&gt;The moment that can't be described, &lt;em&gt;Iguassu Falls, Brazil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite simply breath-taking, there is no photo, video or words that can describe this place. You simply need to see it with your own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/brazil/travel/iguazu-falls-the-waterfall-to-beat-all-waterfalls/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/best-of-2015-(6).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/guatemala/travel/san-pedro-the-perfect-place-to-learn-spanish/" target="_blank"&gt;The moment we felt like we could have stayed forever &amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt; Lake Atitlan, Guatemala&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent two and half weeks here, longer than anywhere else. Such a beautiful place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/guatemala/travel/san-pedro-the-perfect-place-to-learn-spanish/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/best-of-2015-(15).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/usa/travel/monument-valley/" target="_blank"&gt;The moment we sat on the open road, &lt;em&gt;Monument Valley, USA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think it looks like a film set, that's because it is. This iconic landscape is breathtakingly surreal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/usa/travel/monument-valley/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/best-of-2015-(10).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/nicaragua/travel/volcano-boarding-cerro-negro/" target="_blank"&gt;The most overrated moment - Volcano boarding, &lt;em&gt;Nicaragua&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throwing yourself down a volcano on a plank of wood dressed in a stupid suit sounded pretty cool...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/nicaragua/travel/volcano-boarding-cerro-negro/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/best-of-2015-(17).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/usa/travel/redwood-national-park-camping-with-bears-among-the-biggest-trees-on-earth/" target="_blank"&gt;The most "out of this world" moment - Camping in the Redwoods,&lt;em&gt; California, USA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking between the tallest trees on earth is like stepping back in time to a prehistoric age, these huge trees are other worldly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/usa/travel/redwood-national-park-camping-with-bears-among-the-biggest-trees-on-earth/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/best-of-2015-(11).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/guatemala/walking-and-trekking/trekking-volcano-acetenango/" target="_blank"&gt;The most difficult&amp;nbsp;moment &amp;ndash; Climbing Volcano&amp;nbsp;Acatenango, &lt;em&gt;Antigua, Guatemala&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just short of 4000m Acatenango was a challenging, two day, uphill&amp;nbsp;struggle that we were completely under prepared for. In the end it was worth it to view the huge close up eruptions of nearby Volcano Fuego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/guatemala/walking-and-trekking/trekking-volcano-acetenango/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/best-of-2015-(1).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/usa/travel/zion-national-park/" target="_blank"&gt;The moment we found amazing landscapes - &lt;em&gt;Zion National Park, USA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America's greatest secret is its national parks, amazing scenery and hiking without the huge crowds of the Grand Canyon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/usa/travel/zion-national-park/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/best-of-2015-(13).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/belize/travel/caye-caulker-you-better-belize-it/" target="_blank"&gt;Moments you want to last forever - Snorkelling with sting rays and sharks &amp;ndash; Caye Caulker, Belize&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Belize barrier reef is the second largest in the world, Caye Caulker is a chilled out island in the Caribbean sea, put the two together and you have the perfect getaway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/belize/travel/caye-caulker-you-better-belize-it/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/best-of-2015-(2).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/brazil/travel/the-amazon-river-slow-boat-from-leticia-to-manaus/" target="_blank"&gt;The laziest moment - Swinging in a hammock on a four day slow boat down the Amazon,&lt;em&gt; Colombia to Brazil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sit back and watch the world go by on the world's biggest&amp;nbsp;river&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/brazil/travel/the-amazon-river-slow-boat-from-leticia-to-manaus/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/best-of-2015-(19).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/colombia/travel/barichara-canyons-countryside-and-eating-fat-bottomed-ants/" target="_blank"&gt;The moment when eating ants was a good idea - &lt;em&gt;Barichara, Colombia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was sunny and the old colonial town was beautiful, except somewhere nearby fat bottom ants were being fried ready to be eaten. And eat them we did.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The longest zipline in Latin America and a terrifying&amp;nbsp;300ft jump out the tree canopy had me screaming in fear!&lt;/p&gt;

    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;Another year is over and without a doubt this has been one the best years of our lives.

Having passed through 16 countries and spent 243 days on the road 2015 has been one long adventure!&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Yerba Mate</Title>
    <TitleURL>uruguay/drink-reviews/yerba-mate</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-12-30T11:50:45.51+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;This is not an alcoholic drink, however we have made an exception to include it in our drinks review as it is a national obsession in both Argentina and Uruguay. Everywhere we have went we have seen people carrying around these strange looking wooden cups with metal rims called gourds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/yerba-mate-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are filled to the brim with a suspicious looking green herb mixture into which is placed what looks like a silver pipe. On first seeing it we thought it was some sort of illegal drug so became curious to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/yerba-mate-9.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We later found out that the green mixture is not cannabis but the dried leaves of yerba mate. Yerba is a species of holly found in South America which is naturally high in caffeine. The high&amp;nbsp;is claimed to be smoother than coffee without any 'jitters'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/yerba-mate-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dried leaves are piled into the cup and then hot water is pored over allowing the water to be infused. The drinker carries with them&amp;nbsp;a flask of hot water so that they can refill the gourd when they want another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/yerba-mate-6.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to drink it without choking on the leaves a special metal straw is used called a bombilla. This has small holes in the bottom allowing the water to flow through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/yerba-mate-5.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially the drink smells and tastes a bit like drinking infused tobacco. Once you get over the bitter flavour it became quite pleasant. Its unusual taste mixed with the caffeine hit makes you want more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/yerba-mate-7.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are tons of articles on the internet promoting its various health benefits and risks, from aiding weight loss to causing cancer this is certainly a controversial drink. What is clear is that the Argentinians and Uruguayans love it and the people we have spoken to about it only have positive things to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/yerba-mate-4.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternative combinations of mate include mixing the yerba with cold water and lemon juice or with cold orange juice which is supposedly popular in Paraguay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/yerba-mate-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending months throughout Central America drinking bucket loads of coffee we are happy to embrace this local drink for the rest of our South America travels. We only hope it isn&amp;rsquo;t as addictive as it seems as we would certainly get some strange looks drinking this at our desks in England.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Picturesque Uruguay - Colonia Del Sacremento</Title>
    <TitleURL>uruguay/travel/picturesque-uruguay-colonia-del-sacremento</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-01-04T20:00:13.31+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Colonia is Uruguay&amp;rsquo;s most famous colonial city. This picturesque town is an UNESCO world heritage site and is just 50km by ferry from Buenos Aires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/colonia-4.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite possibly the prettiest town we will see in South America the quaint streets and cobble stone roads are mesmerising. When we arrived the historic centre was neither swamped with tourists nor choked with traffic creating a pleasant, relaxed atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/colonia-9.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old gate house and wall still stand complete with drawbridge and cannon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/colonia-16.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/colonia-17.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An old lighthouse rises high above the buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/colonia-6.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most famous street here is a wonderful mixture of colours from yellows to pastel pink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/colonia-19.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The buildings are well looked after, most are now occupied by fancy restaurants and artisanal shops. These come alive at night when they are lit up by candles whilst bottles of red wine flow to the sound of violins and guitars. It was a special moment watching a live classical street band play on the river side pier as the sun set beyond the oceanic horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/colonia-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The town&amp;rsquo;s cobblestone alleys and leafy streets are sprinkled with old vintage cars and wooden carts adding to the historic feel of the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/colonia-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The historic centre is small and easily walkable in one day. We were there for three days which was too long. Perhaps even a day would have been enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/colonia-18.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it allowed us the time to check out some of Uruguay&amp;rsquo;s culture. Starting with the Uruguayan Parrillda, a mixed grill that proves any part of the cow can be eaten. Unable to translate the menu we ate it first then found out later what it was, which was probably for the best as it turned out we had eaten beef sausage, blood sausage, kidney, intestines, rib steak and pork steak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/colonia-11.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The burn marks on my forehead are not from the grill but the sun! You would have thought I would have learnt to put sun cream on by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following day we went to the market to purchase the paraphernalia needed to drink the Uruguayan favourite,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/uruguay/drink-reviews/yerba-mate/" target="_blank"&gt;Yerba Mate.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/colonia-24.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providing a glimpse into Uruguay&amp;rsquo;s past, Colonia is both a pretty and historic part of the country and a must for anyone exploring this part of the world.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>New Years Eve Cider Fight in Montevideo</Title>
    <TitleURL>uruguay/travel/new-years-eve-cider-fight-in-montevideo</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-01-04T20:22:07.36+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;As far as cities go Montevideo is a bit ruff around the edges. Our opinion wasn&amp;rsquo;t helped by the fact it was a dull grey day when we arrived. Looking at the tall concreate structures and crumbling old buildings as they faded into the sky felt a tad disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, we weren&amp;rsquo;t here to criticise the architecture, we were here to party. I had read good things about New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve in Uruguay&amp;rsquo;s capital so when we woke up on the last day of 2015, with the sun finally casting its bright glow on the streets, things immediately started to look better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/montevideo-newyear-9.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the buildings looked more chic than dilapidated, and the open squares, with people crowded around, seemed to be filled with an exciting energy that was infectious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all started at 12pm. Office workers finishing for the day rip up their calendars and planners and throw them out the windows. Paper falls like snow from the tall buildings covering the streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/montevideo-newyear-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next we headed down to the market square. This area is usually filled with tourists who have just disembarked from the cruise ships and ferry&amp;rsquo;s which stop at the nearby port but today it was occupied by the locals who stood mingling in groups seemingly waiting for things to kick off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We began noticing that everyone was drinking out of green plastic cider bottles labelled &lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/uruguay/drink-reviews/la-gijonesa-sidra-dulche-uruguay%E2%80%99s-nye-weapon-of-choice/" target="_blank"&gt;La Gijonesa&lt;/a&gt;. Feeling out of place with our beer we went in search for this drink and found stalls set up around the square selling it by the case load. We stocked up and headed back into the action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/montevideo-newyear-11.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now it had become clear what the cider was for. A few daring soles had already started the battle by aiming and throwing the cider at anyone and everyone who came near them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/montevideo-newyear-19.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quickly descended into full out war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/montevideo-newyear-20.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the police, riding on their Segways, decided it was time to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/montevideo-newyear-7.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one was safe. It was attack or be attacked. Running through the streets drinking cheap cider and throwing it all over people did bring back some memories from our youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/montevideo-newyear-18.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the difference was that in England if you had thrown your drink over someone you were likely to get a punch in the jaw, here people laughed and chased you with their own loaded bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
Posted by &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/IntrepidNomads/"&gt;Intrepid Nomads&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, January 6, 2016&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atmosphere was amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/montevideo-newyear-28.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bands of drummers came down the streets pumping out beats which people could shake their hips to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/montevideo-newyear-21.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the high rise buildings people had water guns, balloons and buckets filled to the brim which would be thrown on people when they least expect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/montevideo-newyear-31.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When things finally began to disperse and the cider began to congeal on our skins we headed back to our hostel to wash the smell of tramps perfume off ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

Posted by &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/IntrepidNomads/"&gt;Intrepid Nomads&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, January 6, 2016&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next part of the evening was the more familiar barbeque and drinks on the rooftop with our new friends from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/montevideo-newyear-35.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversations mixing from Spanish to German to English and plenty of red wine, fire crackers and beer meant this New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve was one we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t forget in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/montevideo-newyear-36.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If 2016 is half as exciting as 2015 we think we are in for a good year.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;As far as cities go Montevideo is a bit ruff around the edges. Our opinion wasn&amp;rsquo;t helped by the fact it was a dull grey day when we arrived. Looking at the tall concreate structures and crumbling old buildings as they faded into the sky felt a tad disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, we weren&amp;rsquo;t here to criticise the architecture, we were here to party. I had read good things about...</ContentPreview>

    <Title>La Gijonesa, sidra dulche – Uruguay’s NYE weapon of choice</Title>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;After the cider fight on New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve it was difficult to wash the smell of this sickly sweet cider from our hair. Bought at around $1.50 a bottle this sugary cider with 4.9% alcohol would look more comfortable in the hands of the hobos rather than the young trendy crowds gathered on the streets on NYE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/montevideo-newyear-14.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it did serve its purpose well. Being chosen as the people of Montevideo&amp;rsquo;s weapon of choice for their street party. We had been told there was a water fight but clearly throwing cider at each other was more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/montevideo-newyear-18.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bought cold it was quite drinkable in the midday heat, but once warm the only thing it was useful for was poring over the nearest persons head. Literally thousands of these bottles were purchased on New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve and the green bottles filled every bin and lined the streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/montevideo-newyear-11.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day as we walked around the aftermath you could still catch the aroma in the air as the pavements had absorbed gallons upon gallons of La Gijonese. After being covered head to toe in it, it may be a while before we can face drinking a sweet cider again.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Uruguayan Tannat</Title>
    <TitleURL>uruguay/drink-reviews/uruguayan-tannat</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-01-04T20:47:05.523+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Uruguayan wine tends to be overshadowed by its neighbour, Argentina, who produce the world renowned Malbec. However, we were pleased to find out that Tannat, like the country that produces it, certainly can hold its own weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tannot-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rare grape is seen as a national heritage to the people of Uruguay who are now winning international awards with their exported wines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wine is known for its high tannin levels and is usually bended with Cabernet Sauvignon or softer grapes such as Merlot creating a full bodied wine which is easy to drink with the popular Uruguayan barbeques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tannot-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being low budget travellers we sampled the cheaper to mid-range bottles. We found that for around US$5 you can find a very good quality wine. Our favourite was by Don Pascal. We drank both the Tannat and the blended Tannat Merlot, both were delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/tannot-2-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We may have finally found a wine which could convert Karl into a connoisseur....&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Tango in Buenas Aries</Title>
    <TitleURL>argentina/travel/tango-in-buenas-aries</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-01-11T20:51:31.807+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;After being disappointed in Rio we had our fingers crossed that Buenos Aires would deliver. We were not disappointed. Buenos is vibrant city full of culture, architecture, tango, steak and delicious wines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/buenasaires-(15).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is also a country with a turbulent political system. We witnessed first-hand how volatile the economy is when the day after we arrived the newly elected president devalued the currency by 30%. Argentina has suffered with high inflation for a while and this was the answer proposed by the new centre right party. Judging by some of the demonstrations we saw in the streets this may not have been the most popular policy change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/buenasaires-(30).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Politics aside, we were pleased to see clear blue skies on our first day. It was a Sunday and the advice from the staff our hostel was to head to nearby San Telmo markets. This was excellent advice as we found the streets lined with artisan stalls, live music and barbeques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/buenasaires-(19).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stopped at a Italian influenced bar to watch some tango.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/buenasaires-(17).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in my element mingling through the crowds with a beer in hand and the sun shining down. The atmosphere in the market was electric and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been happier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some cool street music in Buenas Aires&lt;/p&gt;
Posted by &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/IntrepidNomads/"&gt;Intrepid Nomads&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, January 4, 2016&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After passing from bar to food, to bar, to food, we found ourselves in a familiar surrounding. It turned out that we had happened to find the local English bar called Gibraltar. Playing pool with a pint of cider while steak and ale pie was being served may not have been the most cultural thing to do in the city but it was the perfect way to end one of my favourite days of this trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/buenasaires-(28).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of our time in Buenos Aires was spent walking around the city, and we certainly did a hell of a lot of walking. With so many diverse neighbourhoods and historical buildings it was an excellent way to see the city and stretch our legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/buenasaires-(25).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We started in Plaza de Mayo which is surrounded by an array of architecturally grandiose buildings including Banco de la Nacion and the distinctive house of the president, Casa Rosa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/buenasaires-(24).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We passed the large obelisk built to celebrate Argentina&amp;rsquo;s independence against Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/buenasaires-(11).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also found a clock tower, modelled as a miniature version of Big Ben, built by the English residents in 1916.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/buenasaires-(46).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Argentina is home of the famous revolutionary Che Guevara it is Evita (Eva Peron) who is the country&amp;rsquo;s national heroine. All around the city you can find statues and monuments dedicated to the first lady of Argentina who fought for the rights of the women and those of the working classes but sadly died at a young age. Her grave stands in the Cementerio de la Recoleta and is always filled with flowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/buenasaires-(45).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The graveyard itself is one of the city&amp;rsquo;s main attractions, which we thought was a bit eerie, however once we entered the maze of tombs we saw the appeal. This graveyard is home to the cities rich and famous from over the centuries&amp;rsquo; and it seems they built to the motto &amp;ldquo;the bigger the better&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/buenasaires-(44).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being able to gawp through windows at rooms the size of small churches, filled with coffins of families which had died over the past few hundred years, was all a bit too creepy for our liking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/buenasaires-(39).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final place we visited was the slum turned art show El Caminito.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/buenasaires-(1).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These corrugated iron clad buildings are painted in vibrant colours and decorated with models and classical signage making it a visionary delight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/buenasaires-(47).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I found Buenos Aires to be a captivating city and one which I would be happy to live in, but there was no time for us to go flat hunting as we had a flight booked. It was time for us to head to the end of the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <DateCreated>2016-01-11T21:33:18.597+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Grappamiel is a honey based drink popular in Uruguay, after seeing it for sale in Montevideo we couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist the urge to try this Uruguayan specialty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/grappamiel-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We know that miel is honey in Spanish but Grappa is an Italian drink, a pomace based brandy made from grape skins. This mixture of honey and grappa clearly owes its heritage to the Italian immigrants that came to Uruguay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/grappamiel-3.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first bottle we tryed was 24% alcohol and had a picture of two birds on the front. We really didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to do with it. We guessed it was supposed to be shot or drank like a liqueur but we had no glasses so in true backpacker fashion necked it straight from the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/grappamiel-1-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fully expecting to be stung in the throat for the sake of research, what followed was a pleasant sweet treat of drink. The glowing aftertaste of honey soothes the warm alcohol. It didn&amp;rsquo;t take long to finish the small 200ml sampler, more than impressed we went back for another bigger bottle.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Brazilian Beer</Title>
    <TitleURL>brazil/drink-reviews/brazilian-beer</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-01-11T21:38:16.593+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think we drank enough beer in Brazil, it&amp;rsquo;s a country devoted to cocktails but we did try a few "cervejas". There is a wide selection of artisanal and craft beers but it&amp;rsquo;s often cheaper to buy a bottle of wine or a bottle of spirits than a beer. In the supermarket some artisanal beers where for sale for &amp;pound;10 which could buy you 5 litres of spirits to make &lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/brazil/drink-reviews/caipirinha/" target="_blank"&gt;caipirinhas&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brahama&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This typical Brazilian beer can also be found in the supermarkets in the UK, usually fairly cheap. But where better to drink it than Brazil, it&amp;rsquo;s fairly decent and very palatable. It comes in a vast array of sizes, cans and bottles. From the seemingly small 200ml to my favourite 550ml cans it sold nearly everywhere. Final verdict, predictable, drinkable and refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The name of this beer is Antarctica, with a name like that it must be cold. So cold it gets served wrapped in an insulated holder. Is this just keep your hand warm from the cold can? Or perhaps to keep the beer cold? Or perhaps both. It would sure get you funny looks in England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/rio-de-janiro-50.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beer its self was good and drinkable but a long way from exceptional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall opinion of beer in Brazil is tarnished by the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s expensive in comparison to other drinks, this meant that much of the wide variety available&amp;nbsp;we simply did not get a chance to drink, it&amp;rsquo;s a shame but who cares when you&amp;rsquo;re drinking &lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/brazil/drink-reviews/caipirinha/" target="_blank"&gt;caipirinhas&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;all night long.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think we drank enough beer in Brazil, it&amp;rsquo;s a country devoted to cocktails but we did try a few "cervejas". There is a wide selection of artisanal and craft beers but it&amp;rsquo;s often cheaper to buy a bottle of wine or a bottle of spirits than a beer. In the supermarket some artisanal beers where for sale for &amp;pound;10 which could buy you 5 litres of spirits to make &lt;a href=...</ContentPreview>

    <Title>The End of The Earth - Ushuaia</Title>
    <TitleURL>argentina/travel/the-end-of-the-earth-ushuaia</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-01-13T12:20:20.333+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Ushuaia bills itself as the southern-most city in the world, many people come here for that privilege alone. Others continue further south. It is often called the &amp;lsquo;Gateway to Antarctica&amp;rsquo; as Antarctic bound ships leave from the port of Ushuaia. However, we will not be going any further south on this trip as it&amp;rsquo;s a cool $5,000 to $10,000 to take the ship to the seventh continent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/ushuaia-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ushuaia is located at the very tip of South America on the island of Tierra del Fuego, clinging to the shore of the Beagle channel and surrounded by the last of the snow-capped Andes. We arrived in the height of summer yet the wind was bitingly cold and we quickly exchanged our shorts and flip-flops for hats, gloves and hiking gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Glacier Marshal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hiking to the top of the glacier is totally free, a fact most welcome, as everything in Ushuaia is ridiculously expensive. Our only cost was the taxi to the chairlift at the foot of the glacier. From there it&amp;rsquo;s easy to follow the hiking trails up to the summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/ushuaia-26.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an odd thing but we really appreciated the cold, after spending so long in hot countries being able to hike without sweating felt amazing. Perhaps I loved the cold a bit too much being the only one walking in a T-shirt. It must be something about coming from Newcastle!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/ushuaia-35.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glacier itself is underwhelming, when compared to the other giants in this area of the world. However, the landscape is amazing, the views over the Beagle channel and of Ushuaia are fantastic. Just being there, the feeling of being at end of the world while standing at the top of the glacier was incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Beagle Chanel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boat tour through the Beagle channel was expensive. You get to see sea lions, cormorants and a lighthouse all from the confines of the boat. All of which we could easily do at home in Northumberland at the Farne Islands. The only reason we were going to do it was to sail through Beagle channel at the &amp;ldquo;end of the world&amp;rdquo;. So when the tour was cancelled due to high winds we were not disappointed and decided to hike to Laguna Esmerelda instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/ushuaia-31.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Laguna Esmerelda&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This free hike costs you nothing except the transport, which made missing the boat trip sweeter. The hike started walking through dense forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/ushuaia-5.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trail passed through beautiful scenery, dead forests, glacial streams, beaver dams and peat bogs, all set against the striking backdrop of snow covered peaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/ushuaia-7.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arriving at the turquoise Lake Esmerelda took an hour and a half. It was an excellent surprise to see such incredible scenery!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/ushuaia-11.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We made it back to the trail head in under an hour where our bus driver welcomed us with pastries and a hot drink to warm us up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Museums&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like everything else here the museums were overpriced so we only chose one to visit. We decided the Yamana museum, dedicated to the peoples who once lived in the region, would be the most interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/ushuaia-46.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amongst other things we found out why they lived naked in the cold climate, why only the women swam and that Tierra Del Fuego (Land Of Fire) is named after the fires of the Yamama people visible as the first ships sailed by in the 1500s. Like the stories of many natives we have heard in the Americas it is sad and doesn&amp;rsquo;t end well as they were eventually wiped out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tierra Del Fuego National Park&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visiting the Yamana museum before walking through the national park was worthwhile. Walking along the coastal trail across the mussel beds, in the bitterly cold summer wind really puts into perspective the challenges they faced to survive in this region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/ushuaia-39.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After completing the four hour coastal trail, through wind stricken woods, beaches and deserted coves without ever seeing another person we arrived in the centre of the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/ushuaia-58.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily the sun appeared as we walked some of the smaller trails making it a pleasant experience. The landscape around us was just fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/ushuaia-57.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The park was big enough to spend another few days as we only saw a small part of it, but it was a bit too cold for us to start camping.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Meeting Penguins in Puntas Arenas</Title>
    <TitleURL>chile/travel/meeting-penguins-in-puntas-arenas</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-01-13T12:39:37.117+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Punta Arenas is a large grey commercial port with very little to do. It regularly gets influxes of tourists from the cruise ships which stop here before heading further south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/puntasarenas-43.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The reason we decide to stay here is because of the penguins. Coming this close to the Antarctic we couldn&amp;rsquo;t miss out on the opportunity to get up close and personal with them. There are trips on offer to visit the larger King Penguin colonies but with limited time and money we opted to go visit the&amp;nbsp;Magdalena Penguins. Their name is taken from the island where they live, a two hour ferry ride from Punta Arenas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/puntasarenas-45.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never really considered myself an &amp;lsquo;animal person&amp;rsquo;, however having the opportunity to see so many wonderful and diverse animals in their natural habitat has made me appreciate the wonders of wildlife so much more. My change in attitude became obvious when stepping off the boat to be greeted by hundreds of these adorable black and white creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/puntasarenas-59.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watching them as they waddled along I was overcome with joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/puntasarenas-63.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean look at them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/puntasarenas-55.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/puntasarenas-64.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Feet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/puntasarenas-47.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was amazing being able to get so close to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/puntasarenas-56.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The young ones clearly weren&amp;rsquo;t phased by us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/puntasarenas-70.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could have stayed and watched them for ages but we only had an hour before the ferry left and it was beginning to get a bit chilly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/puntasarenas-57.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, we were privileged to see some amazing wildlife and it seems this time my heart has been well and truly melted.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Argentina has strong cultural links to Italy due to the large number of migrants which travelled across the Atlantic in the early 19th century. As well as the Italian influences on the cuisine, culture and architecture it has also help to define their somewhat unique taste in alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/fernetbranca-41.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fernet-Branca was introduced to us by a group of Argentinians who were travelling in Uruguay, they told us about their love of the Italian liquor and offered us a drink to try. They said it was best served with ice and coke, which is what they gave us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/fernetbranca-40.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is an unexpected mix of herbs, flowers, roots and plants. In total 27 different herbs are used to create this distinctive blend. Trying to pinpoint all the different flavours with just one glass was difficult and we were still unsure whether we even liked it so we decided to invest in our own bottle to try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/fernetbranca-42.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our second attempt did not go as well. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have ice and in a bid to reduce or calorie intake we decided to use diet coke instead. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t good and ended up tasting like drinking mouthwash. We tried again with full fat coke but the results were similar. Maye we needed the ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not be to everyone&amp;rsquo;s taste but it would certainly make an interesting aperitif at a dinner party.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Day 1 - Las Torres to Mirador base de Las Torres</Title>
    <TitleURL>chile/torres-del-paine/day-1-las-torres-to-mirador-base-de-las-torres</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-01-23T18:29:15.81+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Campsite&lt;/strong&gt;: Las Torres&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Costs&lt;/strong&gt;: Entrance Fee CP$18,000 pp. Campsite CP$8,500pp&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance covered&lt;/strong&gt;: 18km&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day1-13.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convoys of buses carted us and hundreds of other keen hikers from Puerto Natales to the Torres del Paine National Park, the most famous park in Chile and Patagonia. We had turned up in Puerto Natales two days beforehand and with the little research we had done we intended to spend 5 days hiking the popular &amp;ldquo;w&amp;rdquo; trek through the park. After speaking to the knowledgeable owner of our hostel we decided this may not be the best idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we were trekking in peak season the campgrounds would be full and the paths can get so busy that you end up walking single file behind a line of others. This did not sound like the kind of experience we wanted. Instead he suggested we do the &amp;ldquo;O&amp;rdquo; which is longer and also goes behind the main towers but would be a lot quieter. With time available we decided this sounded like the best option but not wanting to miss out on reaching the famous base of the Torres we decided we could camp at the bottom and climb up and down on the first day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day1-5.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after a two hour bus journey and lengthy registration process we were finally in the park. The shuttle bus dropped us off outside Las Torres and we set up camp. We wished we had checked the rental equipment more thoroughly as we realised we didn&amp;rsquo;t have guide ropes and one of the walking poles was broken. As we had decided to share a pair between the two of us this meant one of us was now poleless. A heated argument was had in which poles were thrown around the campsite until we eventually managed to repair the broken one in such a way that I would be able to use it. Then we were off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day1-3.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great thing about camping at the Las Torres camp was that we were able to walk up without our heavy bags. I was thankful as although there were a few clouds in the sky it was hot and carrying a heavy load did not look pleasant. However, there was no point in pitying the walkers with the enormous bags as we knew that would be us tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day1-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The walk up gradually got steeper and the final section to the mirador was a difficult path of boulders and rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day1-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a lot of people doing this walk and when we got to the top we realised why. The view of the Torres was out of this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day1-9.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vibrant greens of the lake contrasted against the grey walls of water that dripped from the glaciers&amp;nbsp;causing subtle movements which made it look as if it were alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day1-17.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It almost looked like icings dripping from a cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day1-18.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our first day had been a success and we wondered, as we walked back down, whether or not we had just seen the best the park has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Day 2 - Las Torres to Seron</Title>
    <TitleURL>chile/torres-del-paine/day-2-las-torres-to-seron</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-01-23T18:32:28.177+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Campsite&lt;/strong&gt;: Seron&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Costs&lt;/strong&gt;: Campsite CP$8,500pp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance Covered&lt;/strong&gt;: 12km&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first day carrying our backpacks full of camping equipment, food and water. Mine hurt just lifting it on my back. Karl&amp;rsquo;s was worse, holding a majority of the camping gear and a weeks worth of food, including the 5kg of cheese he insisted on taking. Conveniently we were able to weigh the bags at the campsite and found out the true weight of the loads. Mine came in at 11kg and Karl&amp;rsquo;s at 17kg. Although 11kg was considered light I argued that, at a quarter of my body weight, this was more than enough for me to be carrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day2-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to be deterred, we set off in the glorious sunshine full of optimism and ready for adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day2-4.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our spirits began to be crushed slightly when the beginning of the walk turned steep. As we slowly edged up the hills the sunshine was no longer a blessing but a curse as the heat made walking more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day2-3.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mercifully the path flatted out and we were able to enjoy the walk through summer meadows and daisy fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day2-9.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All was going swimmingly until the horseflies attacked. They seemed to be fond of me but really loved Karl as they began to terrorise him from all angles. Despite the annoying insects we began to get into our stride and enjoy the freedom of walking into the wild with only the things on our back to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day2-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sun was so strong that we both got sunburt, it seemed that we had prepared for wind, rain and snow but hadn&amp;rsquo;t expected the weather to be so nice. I could deal with a little sunburn but I was not sure how I would cope with the other elements so I had my fingers crossed that the good weather was here to stay as the weather in the park is notorious for changing quickly.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Day 3 - Seron To Lago Dickson</Title>
    <TitleURL>chile/torres-del-paine/day-3-seron-to-lago-dickson</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-01-23T18:34:33.807+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Campsite&lt;/strong&gt;: Dickson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Costs&lt;/strong&gt;: Campsite CP$6,000pp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance Covered&lt;/strong&gt;: 18km&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our shoulders were beginning to hurt almost as soon as we put the bags on and with an 18km hike ahead of us this seemed like it would be a long day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day3-4.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking in the scenery meant time passed quickly and we reached the half way point before lunch time. There were some steep assents at the beginning but mainly it was just a nice, pleasant walk which we completed at a leisurely pace in 6 and a half hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day3-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the walk we were able to solve the mystery of the blue tent stains. Last night as we set up the tent we saw what looked like ink on the tent. As we had rented the equipment we were concerned and began trying to clean it off, but it was difficult, and we were worried we would have to pay for the damage. We couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out where it came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on the walk today we noticed bushes filled with blackberries. These seemed the likely culprit, however, when squashed the juice was red and wiped off easily. Then we spotted the real cause. Innocent looking birds eating the berries left a trail of dark, ink coloured stains from where they stood. We had solved the case. We were pretty confident we could not be liable for birds pooping on our tent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day3-11.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the afternoon, as I was focused on the path ahead, I happened to glance to my right. I had to look twice as what at first looked like sky actually turned out to be a glacier hanging off the mountains in the distance. A welcome addition to the surrounding scenery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day3-13.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weather today was overcast with drizzle. We didn&amp;rsquo;t complain as it made it easier to walk uphill with the bags than the blazing heat of the day before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day3-18.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 18km of walking we were pleased to arrive at the beautiful lakeside campsite. There is no better feeling after a long walk than taking the heavy packs off and lying on the grass looking at the enormous mountains which surround you. Enjoying the feeling of bliss as your muscles relax into the cool grass is a comfy reward for your hard effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day3-22.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than relaxing a few crazy people decided it would be a good idea to jump into the ice cold glacier lake. Not surprisingly they recorded the event with their cameras. The curse of the Go-pro strikes again.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Day 4 - Lago Dickson to Camp Paso </Title>
    <TitleURL>chile/torres-del-paine/day-4-lago-dickson-to-camp-paso</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-01-23T18:55:39.267+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Campsite&lt;/strong&gt;: Paso&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Costs&lt;/strong&gt;: Campsite FREE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance Covered&lt;/strong&gt;: 24km&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well and truly into our flow we set off originally planning on staying at Perro camp but we arrived there at 1pm and not wanting to hang around we decided to power on and go for Paso camp. This meant we would be combining what we planned as 2 days into 1, including the hardest part of the entire trek, the summit of Paso John Gardner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day4-4.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we left Perro camp at 1.45pm the park ranger told us we would be the last on the trail as 2pm was the cut of time to begin this particular section. We weren&amp;rsquo;t too concerned, with 17 hours of daylight it wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to get dark anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day4-11.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The walk turned out to be quite difficult and steep with a rocky uneven path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/day4extra-(1).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But once we reached the 1200m summit we were rewarded with the most outstanding view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day4-12.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pains went away as we were able to see miles and miles of glacier ice fields which, from a distance, looked similar to the ripples of the classic 80&amp;rsquo;s dessert, Viennetta ice-cream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/day4extra-(2).jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We stood for a while taking in the immense power of this natural structure. As we were the last people on the walk we had the place to ourselves which was a truly spectacular experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day4-29.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the camp was all the way down the other side so we still had another 3 hours of difficult downhill walking to endure. As we were beginning to feel tired it was a challenge trying not to fall over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day4-35.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had set off from Dickson camp at 9am and were pleased when our sore feet finally reached Paso camp at 7pm. The camp was basic but it was free. It really didn&amp;rsquo;t matter anyway as by this point we could have fallen asleep anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Day 5 - Camp Paso to Paine Grande </Title>
    <TitleURL>chile/torres-del-paine/day-5-camp-paso-to-paine-grande</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-01-30T12:58:38.747+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Campsite&lt;/strong&gt;: Paine Grande&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Costs&lt;/strong&gt;: Campsite $7,000 pp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance Covered&lt;/strong&gt;: 21km&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we were blessed with more blue skies as we set off for another long day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day5-3.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From leaving the camp the trail felt like an obstacle course. We had to negotiate our way across rivers, climb ladders and edge our way across vertigo inducing suspension bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day5-10.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It certainly made the morning more interesting. Before we knew it we were back amongst the crowds of people as we approached camp Grey. This is a popular campsite for those doing the &amp;ldquo;w&amp;rdquo; trek as it well situated next to the glacier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day5-6.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The afternoon was a bit easier with regular viewpoints to stop off at along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day5-19.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The path was dry and dusty and as we passed more and more people I became aware of the fact we hadn&amp;rsquo;t showered or even looked in a mirror for past two days. By this point in the trek we no longer cared how we looked or smelt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day5-18.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did a lot of downhill and uphill walking and our legs were beginning to ache. The plus point was that the pains in our legs masked the pains in our shoulders. Unfortunately, these came back when walking on the flat. We were glad when we finally arrive in the haven that is Paine Grande campsite, complete with mini mart and bar. After 5 days of trekking we had developed a sugar addiction and went crazy spending almost &amp;pound;10 on chocolate. We then ended the day celebrating completing two difficult days with a well-deserved glass of vino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day5-26.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Campsite&lt;/strong&gt;: Paine Grande&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Costs&lt;/strong&gt;: Campsite $7,000 pp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance Covered&lt;/strong&gt;: 21km&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance Covered&lt;/strong&gt;: 20km&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With time to spare we decided to spend two nights camping at Pine Grande. This meant we could enjoy not having to pack up camp or carry our heavy bags around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day6-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our hike today led us to Francis valley where we could see another part of the &amp;ldquo;w&amp;rdquo; trek. We originally planned to get to the Britanico lookout but managed to get ourselves lost. Instead we found a nice secluded spot to have lunch and watch the avalanches from the nearby mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day6-4.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again we were amazing with how nice the weather was as we had another hot day with plenty of sunscreen being required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day6-6.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great thing about trekking in this park is there are regular sources of ice cold glacier water so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to lug around heavy bottles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/day-6-extra.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walking back to camp we couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe how quickly the time had went. Sadly tomorrow was to be our last day in the park.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Day 7 - Paine Grande to Administration </Title>

    <Content>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Campsite&lt;/strong&gt;: NA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance Covered&lt;/strong&gt;: 17km&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today we woke up early and caught the sunrise over the lake. The air was still, allowing perfect reflections in the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day7-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were both sad to be leaving but I knew my hips would&amp;nbsp;thank me for sleeping in a bed tonight. Rather than spend money on an expensive ferry ride to catch the bus we decided to make the most of the day and walk to the administration centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day7-4.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This turned out to be an excellent idea as the path was enjoyably flat, passing through yet another, diverse landscape of grass fields. We also spotted a surprising large amount of birds, many of which we hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen anywhere else in the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day7-6.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We stopped half way at Las Carrettsas camp and to get rid of the last of our food we had a bazar breakfast of chicken curry followed by porridge and dried kiwi. It was here where we met an English couple just starting their trek. The lady was saying she didn&amp;rsquo;t know how she was going to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made me reflect on my own thoughts at the beginning of the trip and how unfit I felt on our first day. I was proud of how well we had both did, hopefully this was to be the beginning of kick starting our fitness as we had previously been settling into a lazy backpackers lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/torresdelpaine-day7-10.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaching the administration building felt great. Our bodies were acing but this felt surprisingly good. All the pain had been worth it. We basked in our achievement while lying in the sun waiting for the bus to take us back to Puerto Natales. For both of us the past week was the highlight of our trip so far. A truly unforgettable experience.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Glacier Perito Merano</Title>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Creeping down the mountain at glacial pace, that is two meters a day, crashing and melting spectacularly into a lake of turquoise water is the awe inspiring Glacier Perito Merano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/perritio-merrano-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set within the backdrop of Parque Nacional Los Glaciares, Argentina, the glaciers monstrous force can be witnessed close up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/perritio-merrano-16.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thunderous cracks and booms can be heard as the glacier rumbles, cracking and melting slowly into Lago Argentino. Large chunks of the 60 meter high (above water), 5km wide glacier literally fall off before your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/perritio-merrano-22.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a sign near the glacier that&amp;rsquo;s states, &amp;lsquo;do not pass&amp;rsquo; 33 people died due to falling ice. Obviously we stay within the &amp;lsquo;safe&amp;rsquo; area, well you don&amp;rsquo;t have much choice now as there are several purpose built walkways to keep you contained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/perritio-merrano-21.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sun is shining and its 20 degrees yet before our eyes stands a wall of ice as if it was The Wall directly from Games of Thrones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/perritio-merrano-13.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except this is no fantasy story this is the natural world at its finest.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Dulce De Leche Liquor</Title>
    <TitleURL>argentina/drink-reviews/dulce-de-leche-liquor</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-01-30T13:09:00.12+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Dulce Del Leche is a favourite of Argentinians, this sweet sugar and milk spread is sold everywhere and can be witnessed being ate for breakfast daily. It tastes amazing in a sweet, give me more way, that is until you feel sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/dulce-de-leche-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drink we are going to try is a liqueur made of dulche de leche, at first glance I can tell it&amp;rsquo;s going to be sweet. It looks brown and gooey, shake the bottle and the contents hardly move. It&amp;rsquo;s a respectable 17% alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/dulce-de-leche-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the drink pours slowly into the glass, swirling it leaves a thick residue on the side. Coating it in brown sugary goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/dulce-de-leche-4.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking the first sip, the first thing I notice is the consistency. It&amp;rsquo;s quite possibly the thickest drink I have tasted, its slithers down your throat leaving a trail of ice cream, caramel and of course dulce de leche flavourings before the alcoholic kick ever so slightly warms the belly. The drink reminds me of a thicker, sweeter version of Bailys Irish cream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice drink but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure drinking the full bottle would be good for your health, it&amp;rsquo;s just too sweet. But right now that&amp;rsquo;s not going to stop me having another.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>El Chalten – I would walk 500 miles</Title>
    <TitleURL>argentina/travel/el-chalten-i-would-walk-500-miles</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-01-30T18:42:40.707+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;We came to Patagonia to hike and hiking is what we did. After a few days break in El Calafate we couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait to get our hiking boots on and head back out into the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-chalten-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;El Chalten is a small village nestled within the northern section of Los Glaciers National Park. On entering by bus you are taken to the Rangers office for a short introduction and are provided with a map with all the hikes clearly marked. With four nights booked all we had to do was decide which one to do first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Los Condores and Las Aguilas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arriving in the afternoon we decided to start with two of the easier trails. The two walks can be combined to form a 5km walk which takes you to the top of the mountain closest to the visitor&amp;rsquo;s centre where you can get views over El Chalten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-chalten-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Climbing a bit further up to Las Aguilas you get splendid views of Viedma Lake and Tunel Bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-chalten-6.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We stayed at the top for a while with a cup of wine admiring the views until the wind became too strong for us and we were forced to retreat back into the valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laguna Torre and View point Maestri &amp;ndash; 10km 4hrs one way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-chalten-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still concerned about the winds we decided to opt for this walk as it only has a 300 metre ascent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-chalten-12.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the walks we did this was our least favourite, it seemed to be a bit long and boring and due to the low lying clouds we weren&amp;rsquo;t able to get the best views when we reached the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-chalten-18.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t get us wrong, it was still a beautiful place to visit, but after trekking in Torres del Paine this was a bit of an anti-climax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this trek was that we finally got to spot some wildlife other than birds. As we were about the head back from the lake we heard a strange sound, almost like a cross between a bird and frog. We soon noticed others pointing in the direction of the sound and seen that it was a Patagonian fox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-chalten-22.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karl, thinking he was David Attenborough, got us a bit too close for my comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laguna de los Tres &amp;ndash; 10km 4hrs one way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-chalten-24.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the most popular trek in the park, taking you to the spectacular viewpoint of the Fitzroy Mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-chalten-28.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the path is relatively easy and flat and has some lovely views along the valleys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-chalten-31.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The challenging bit comes at the end where there is a steep climb to the top. You can do it at a steady pace in around an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-chalten-36.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effort put in is well rewarded when you reach the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-chalten-39.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loma del Pilegue Tumbado &amp;ndash; 10km 4hrs one way.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-chalten-52.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This turned out to be our favourite walk and is one of the least crowded. It starts at the visitors centre and follows a gradual uphill incline for a majority of the walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-chalten-54.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trail passes through open meadows and pine forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-chalten-56.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually the ground turns to slate and on a clear day you begin to see a marvellous panoramic view of all the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-chalten-66.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best views are seen from the summit of Loma del Pliegue Tumbado at 1490 meters high. It is a steep trail that could be dangerous on a windy day. Thankfully for us the wind held back and we were able to sit for an hour at the top, basking in the sun whilst trying to take in all the amazing scenery which surrounded us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/el-chalten-67.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going downhill is usually the worst part of the hike but after you get past the steep slate section the gradual decline meant we were back in El Chalten in no time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chorrillo del Salto&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On our last day our feet and muscles were beginning to fail us and the winds had picked up again. Fortunately we had saved the easiest walk for a day like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Bariloche - Argentina's Lake District</Title>
    <TitleURL>argentina/travel/bariloche-argentina's-lake-district</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-02-11T12:41:20.98+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no denying the scenic beauty of Bariloche, as we enter Argentina&amp;rsquo;s lake district the landscape changes from the vast desolate scrublands of Patagonia into a green alpine like landscape dotted with lakes and mountains with matching houses built in wooden European styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/barriloche-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The town is the centre of Argentina&amp;rsquo;s chocolate industry and there are dozens of chocolate shops on the high street. It would have been a crime not try one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/barriloche-4.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being the tourist hub of the region we thought that it would be easy to travel to the nearby sites. It turned out that we were wrong to be so optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were advised by the staff at tourist information to take local buses around the main route, the 60km Circuito Chico. We were given a map and timetable of the buses and were told where was best to get on and off. It all sounded great except that to get on the busses you need to have a SUBE card which are impossible to get hold of and cash is not accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/barriloche-6.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending half a day trying to obtain one we finally gave in and paid a tour company a ridiculous price to take us around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first stop on the tour was the chair lift to the top of Cerro Campanario for spectacular views of the surrounding area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/barriloche-14.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/barriloche-7.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many people here willing to spend a lot of money as demonstrated by our next stop on the tour, driving through the grounds of Argentina&amp;rsquo;s most famous hotel Llao Llao. An eye-watering US$1,200 will get you a room for a night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a short walk through the forests we follow the road round and stop for a better view. Admittedly it does look heavenly from up here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/barriloche-16.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We both agree that this place feels like the Amalfi coast except instead of the sea we have lakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/barriloche-9.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour ends in a Swedish settlement village where you can grab a drink and a bite to eat or go and have a swim in the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it was a good day but it would have been more enjoyable and cheaper to be able to do it ourselves. Unfortunate this is once again another example of some of the inefficient systems in place in Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Malbec in Mendoza </Title>
    <TitleURL>argentina/drink-reviews/malbec-in-mendoza</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-02-11T12:44:09.73+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Mendoza is known world-wide as the capital of Argentinian wines. The area is surrounded by vineyards and there are ample tours available which can cater for the expert connoisseur&amp;nbsp;to the basic backpackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After assessing what was on offer we decided to go for our own self-guided tour of the vineyards in the nearby area of Maipu. The best way to get around is to cycle. When you hop off the bus there are many places offering to rent bikes. They also provide you with a basic map so you can plan your own route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/mendoza-27.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We decided to head to one of the vineyard furthest away to work our way back. This was all well and good but the maps weren&amp;rsquo;t exactly to scale and it ended up being 10km away. I was not too happy to be turning up for our first tour bright red and sweating, gasping for water rather than wine in the blistering heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/mendoza-13.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a short tour around the small family run vineyard we were able to recover with a tasting of 6 different wines including a Merlot, Tempranillo, Syrah, Malbec, Cabernet Saviogne and Pleno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/mendoza-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both agreed the Malbec was our favourite. The deep red was delicious, with subtle floral and dried fruit aromas and sweet round tannins, it left us wanting more. Thankfully we didn&amp;rsquo;t have to cycle too far as the next vineyard was only 1km away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/mendoza-16.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here we stopped for lunch with a bottle of Malbec. The view over the vineyards was superb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/mendoza-26.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great thing about cycling around Maipu is that you can break up your wine tasting by visiting other places. We decided to stop off at an olive oil and liquor tasting room. After sampling 6 shots of extremely sweet liquors trying to steer the bike in a straight line was becoming more and more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/mendoza-31.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Karl&amp;rsquo;s orders, our next stop was the beer garden which turned out to be a lovely place to relax in the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/mendoza-33.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feeling like we were becoming hazards on the road we handed our bikes back and walked to our final tasting room where we sampled another 5 wines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/mendoza-37.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unable to take any more Malbec, Karl ended the day enjoying his beer while I managed to fit in one more small gall of vino before stumbling back to the hostel.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Disaster in the Desert!</Title>
    <TitleURL>chile/travel/disaster-in-the-desert</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-02-11T12:50:00.577+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;The day started the way it meant to go on. Hungover from drinking too much in the wineries of Mendoza we got up, took some breakfast and wandered across the city to the bus station hoping for some luck. For the past three days the road to Santiago, Chile had been closed. The high road across the Andes had been shut due to a bridge collapsing during bad weather leaving us stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrodeatacama-3.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time luck was on our side, the road was opened in the morning and we took the first bus out of there. The scenic mountain road was only spoiled by the crazy immigration process to get into Chile. The road closure had caused long delays. Four to five hours we waited as the guards inefficiently searched for the offending apples, pears and beef steaks. Taking animal or food products across the border is strictly forbidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had arrived in Santiago without a hotel (we never booked in advance due to the road closure). It was also five hours later than expected and dark. Looking for a cheap hotel in the chaotic city would have been a nightmare so we decided to check the bus timetable to San Pedro de Atacama. Sure enough there was a bus leaving at 22.45 so we took it in the safe knowledge we could sleep on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The twenty hour bus ride went smoothly and the obligatory ham and cheese sandwiches were served for breakfast, lunch and tea. We looked forward to arriving in San Pedro de Atacama at around 8pm. Then unexpectedly, at around 6pm, the bus stopped at San Andenes unloaded us and promptly disappeared, the driver promising us he would be back in ten minutes. One hour and half later and the bus came back easing our worries but we now knew we would not be arriving on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12.30am and we arrived at the edge of the desert town of San Pedro de Atacama. It was dark, the dusty streets unlit and there was no one around. After walking the wrong way we stopped to ask two children playing in the street which way the centre was. Without the aid of light we walked for ten minutes and came upon the first hostel which was of course full. We continued on to the centre, a few people were drinking in the bars everything else was closed and so were most of the hostels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrodeatacama-6.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each hostel we tried was full, most even had a paper with &amp;ldquo;full&amp;rdquo; scribbled and pinned to the front door. It was getting late and getting close to two in the morning, it looked like we would be sleeping on the floor, our only hope was to cuddle up to a stray dog for warmth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily Leanne had a better idea, in the last hostel we visited she spotted two hammocks in the garden and thought they looked a comfortable place to sleep. It certainly wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do any harm in asking. The hostel owner, a Chilean woman looked bemused but wanted to help. She said it gets to below zero in the desert and that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a good idea as we would freeze. We offered to pay, she said we could put a tent up but we didn&amp;rsquo;t have one. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t looking good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a kind Chilean gentleman, speaking in Spanish offered us the chance to sleep in his car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrodeatacama-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course we said yes, in fact the man had just saved us from wandering around all night in the cold. The hostel owner brought us some warm blankets and made us a cup of tea. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t much longer until we were settled down in the car, which was new, super clean and more pleasant than some hostels!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After setting off from Mendoza over 40 hours ago we were reclined in the front two seats of a cramped Suzuki Swift. To us it felt like the Hilton and we drifted off into perfect sleep. The next morning we woke after the sun rose. We left a note for our anonymous hero in Spanish thanking him for his kind deed accompanied with 10000 Chilean pesos so he could by a few beers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We left the car that morning feeling happy as we continued our search for a room. Which in the end you will be pleased to know we did find.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>San Pedro de Atacma - Valle de Luna</Title>
    <TitleURL>chile/travel/san-pedro-de-atacma-valle-de-luna</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-02-11T12:50:46.74+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Valle de Luna is located 13 Km from San Pedro de Atacama, named because of its rock and sand formations which are said to resemble the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrodeatacama-36.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the most famous tour from San Pedro and there are literally a hundred companies offering the tour. The first stop, on the one we chose, was a walk through a salt cave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrodeatacama-11.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all got stuck half way, on the way out a girl had fell and split her head open halting everyone in their tracks. We hope she was okay. As we climbed past her and out of the cave we came upon the salt landscape, weathered by the yearly rains this landscape did look moon like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrodeatacama-15.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next up our tour guide drove us to the Tres Marias, though it should have probably been called the Dos Marias as some idiot had recently climbed on one and sent it crumbling to the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrodeatacama-16.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was another 45 minute drive in the bus before we had the chance to climb upwards out of the valley, this time by foot, with most people struggling due to the altitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrodeatacama-19.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was worth it as the views were out of this world, though I&amp;rsquo;m tempted to say more like Mars than the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrodeatacama-22.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We could see the salt on the valley floor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrodeatacama-24.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A snaking sand dune just waiting to be trampled on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrodeatacama-29.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And some nice rock formations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrodeatacama-32.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the way down we got to watch vertigo induced people struggle with their fears, once we were all safely down we took to the bus again to find a spot to watch the sunset a fitting end to the tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrodeatacama-33.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Bolivian Salt Flats - Day 1</Title>
    <TitleURL>bolivia/salar-de-uyuni/bolivian-salt-flats-day-1</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-02-11T12:59:56.06+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;We set off early from San Pedro de Atacama and made our way to the Bolivian border by bus, when the tarmacked road turned to bumpy gravel we knew we were close. The border post was small and innocuous. The air was thin and our breathing was laboured but we were just about to enter the Bolivian altiplano, a huge expanse of Andean plateau at an average height of nearly 4000m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrotounyuni-day1-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no roads going to our destination, Uyuni, so after getting our stamp into Bolivia everybody was unloaded off the bus and split into groups of 6, the 4x4 we were about to enter was to be ours for the next 3 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrotounyuni-day1-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first stop was to see the altiplano lakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laguna Blanca&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This salt lake has a characteristic white hue which gives it its name&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrotounyuni-day1-4.jpg" alt="Laguna Blanca"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrotounyuni-day1-7.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laguna Verde&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we guessed this lake has a green tinge, in the background is an active volcano which if you are brave enough you can climb. At nearly 6000m it surely couldn&amp;rsquo;t be fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrotounyuni-day1-12.jpg" alt="Laguna Verde"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desert of Dali&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This surreal landscape is named after the famous painter Salvador Dali, it&amp;rsquo;s not hard to see why. If you have ever seen any of his paintings then you instantly get the connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrotounyuni-day1-15.jpg" alt="desert of dali"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so we carried on the journey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrotounyuni-day1-21.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thermal Spring&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next stop on the agenda is a thermal spring, although everyone in our group decides against going in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrotounyuni-day1-24.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Geyser Sol de Manana&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the high altitude the alitplano is one of the most active landscapes in the world. Surrounded by volcanoes it&amp;rsquo;s not surprising that you can witness the geological activity first hand. The ground is hot and sulphurous with bubbling mud, releasing hot gases which gives it the name &amp;ldquo;geyser&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrotounyuni-day1-28.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laguna Colorado&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lake is coloured by red sediments and red algae which a huge flock of pink flamingos are constantly filtering through their systems. We spend some time here before heading to our evening&amp;rsquo;s accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrotounyuni-day1-34.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent the night with the rest of our group eating, and drinking a few beers before heading to a cold and damp room, which we shared with the rest of the group to sleep, the coldness of the desert night was amplified as Leanne was given a new nickname &amp;lsquo;blanket stealer&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;We set off early from San Pedro de Atacama and made our way to the Bolivian border by bus, when the tarmacked road turned to bumpy gravel we knew we were close. The border post was small and innocuous. The air was thin and our breathing was laboured but we were just about to enter the Bolivian altiplano, a huge expanse of Andean plateau at an average height of nearly 4000m.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Bolivian Salt Flats - Day 2</Title>

    <DateCreated>2016-02-11T13:13:57.32+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;After a difficult night&amp;rsquo;s sleep we woke in a cold damp room set within the desolate landscape of the Bolivian altiplano, meanwhile celebrations were beginning outside. Today was carnival, a major celebration in Bolivia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrotounyuni-day2-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cute Bolivian kids had covered the jeeps in balloons and confetti and the drivers were opening bottles of Corona. Drunk drivers are often stated as a problem in reviews of this trip, however, we were lucky as our driver was a dedicated Christian and did not drink at all, or at least that&amp;rsquo;s what he told us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrotounyuni-day2-3.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As our driver headed away from the hotel he removed all the decorations on the jeep and told us it would it would be a long day. I would soon find out he wasn&amp;rsquo;t lying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first stop was to see some llamas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrotounyuni-day2-5.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Followed soon after by a pit stop to view a famous weathered rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrotounyuni-day2-7.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no passing up the opportunity to do some rock climbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrotounyuni-day2-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We passed volcanoes, drove over rocks, and stopped to take some photos of a multi-coloured mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrotounyuni-day2-19.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next drive felt like an eternity, the combination of bumpy roads and the fact that I am over 6 feet tall and crushed in the back of a jeep did not make for a pleasant experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Laguna Altiplanicas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lake was beautiful but my body was aching and tired. The driver was right about this being a long day. But we made the most of it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrotounyuni-day2-30.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Solar de Chiguana &amp;ndash; 3 volcanos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrotounyuni-day2-33.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We stopped at the centre point of three volcanoes,&amp;nbsp;having spent so long travelling people were beginning to get tired and in need of some rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Salt Hotel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 10 hours of driving we arrived at our bed for the night, which turned out to be a hotel made entirely of salt. Luckily we acquired a private room, once the novelty of salt walls and the powdery salt floor wore off we realised it looked somewhat like a prison cell. At least there would be plenty flavouring for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrotounyuni-day2-35.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For tea we ate the local Bolivian speciality, Pique Machu, consisting of llama, chips, fried onions, pepper and boiled eggs. It&amp;rsquo;s not gourmet but it tasted good. After we finished the huge pile of food it started to rain, we were grateful&amp;nbsp;the salt hotel didn&amp;rsquo;t dissolve and were able to drift off into a much needed sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Beagle Channel Beer</Title>
    <TitleURL>argentina/drink-reviews/beagle-channel-beer</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-02-11T22:53:20.877+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Being in Ushuaia the southern-most city of the world I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect there to be much beer available, yet alone an Irish bar. Well, the Irish bar didn&amp;rsquo;t surprise me too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/30birthday-39.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it did come as a revelation that the beer here was some of the best we have tasted in South America. The beer we opted to try is brewed locally by the Beagle Channel Brewery. They use the fresh water from Glacier Marshal and this certainly seems to make it more refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/ushuaia-31.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was also several beers brewed by Cape Horn brewery but costing nearly &amp;pound;5 a pint for both the Beagle and Cape Horn we couldn&amp;rsquo;t try them all and instead decided to go for a selection of Beagle beers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuegian Rubia Ale &amp;ndash; 5.8%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/30birthday-48.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuegian Negra-Stout &amp;ndash; 7.8%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/30birthday-44.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rojo-India Pale Ale &amp;ndash; 6.6%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/30birthday-46.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not realising the strong percentages of these drinks intoxication came pretty fast, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to pretend I remember exactly what the taste like, it was my 30th birthday after all, but they really were world class beers. My favourite by far was the stout, It&amp;rsquo;s just a shame I couldn&amp;rsquo;t bring any home.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>La Paz – Bolivias Sin City </Title>
    <TitleURL>bolivia/travel/la-paz-bolivias-sin-city</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-02-17T14:26:12.097+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Set at an altitude of 3660m La Paz is Bolivia&amp;rsquo;s Sin City. The sprawling mass of half constructed buildings climb up the nearby hillside as far as the eye can see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/lapaz-12.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We arrived in the city at 4.30am on a bus from Uyuni. Despite being at high altitude for the past week, the lack of oxygen mixed with the pollution choked us as soon as we began walking. Unfortunately, this is not a city you want to be wondering around in the early hours of the morning so we sat for a few hours sipping coffee in the bus station until it was a reasonable hour to venture out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/lapaz-9.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bolivia is unlike any other South American country we have been to so far. With a majority of the people being indigenous there seems to be a fierce rejection of westernisation. The way in which the local women dress is certainly unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/sanpedrotounyuni-day1-26.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite being an ugly and notoriously dangerous city it attracts hundreds of backpackers all of which congregate in the many hostels surrounding the area known as the witches market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/lapaz-7.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These strange stalls ran by tiny women in traditional dress sell everything from love potions to coca leaves, hallucinogenic cactuses and dried lama foetuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/lapaz-4.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are numerous items on sale for the various rituals which they carry out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/lapaz-3.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has to be one of the strangest places we have been to so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Coca Museum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of Bolivia&amp;rsquo;s more controversial traditions is the chewing of the Coca leaf. We had seen people all over the city stuffing these dried leaves into their mouths and were curious to find out more. We had heard from many people that the leaf can ease the symptoms of altitude sickness and as we were both suffering we were willing to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To find out all the facts we headed to the local Coca Museum, which despite being small was filled with a lot of information. It was clear this was one tradition the Bolivians will not be giving up anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/lapaz-6.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also found out the correct way to consume the coca. We had previously seen tourists buying the bags of dried leaves and simply stuff them in their mouths and start chewing. This, as we found out in the museum, was incorrect. To get any sort of stimulating effect you need to add an alkaloid. This was purchased in the form of a sweet tasting calk like block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/alkaloideblockforcocaleaves-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small amount is crumbled into the dried leaves, of which about 10 is recommended. This is then rolled up and stuffed into the side of your mouth. After about 30 minutes you will start to feel a slight numbing in your gums and a mild boost of energy. A bit like having a coffee. Unfortunately, as many tourists find out to their disappointment, this is nothing like the potent high given by the other illegal derivative of the plant, Cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/cocaineinwirting.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is not to say that Cocaine is not also widely available. In fact La Paz is also famous for being home to the world&amp;rsquo;s first Cocaine bar, Route 36. Jump in any taxi inconspicuously waiting outside the party hostels at dark and they will take you to the bar where along with a beer you can also get a gram of Bolivia&amp;rsquo;s finest delivered to your table on a plate. It&amp;rsquo;s still illegal but apparently the police are willing to turn a blind eye, for a certain fee of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The city was certainly eye opening. But after being robbed (Pickpocketed while in a pizza restaurant), we were pleased to see the back of this crazy city and head to the more tranquil shores of Lake Titicaca.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;Set at an altitude of 3660m La Paz is Bolivia&amp;rsquo;s Sin City. The sprawling mass of half constructed buildings climb up the nearby hillside as far as the eye can see.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Guarana</Title>
    <TitleURL>brazil/drink-reviews/guarana</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-02-21T14:53:15.72+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;As soon as we crossed the amazon border into Brazil Guarana was the most popular soft drink, although it&amp;rsquo;s not alcoholic we found it suitable for a review. Guarana is a climbing plant that is native to the amazon basin and Brazil, the berry is what provides the caffeine hit making this an ideal energy supplement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/guarana-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have seen guarana added many times to products in England and yet we had no idea what it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first drink we tried was called Bare, it came in a bright yellow can and was our first taste of this Brazilian favourite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the heat this sweet and energy giving drink quickly becomes addictive. Not wanting to gain too much weight we quickly moved on to the Zero version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/guarana-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s pretty much the same without the added sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We even found it an ideal mixer for the rest of our Medellin rum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout Brazil this was a good replacement for coffee but as soon as we left Brazil we quickly said good bye to this addictive Amazonian speciality.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Licor De Cerveza </Title>
    <TitleURL>argentina/drink-reviews/licor-de-cerveza</TitleURL>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Licor De Cerveza probably translates to Beer Liquor which when translated sounds less appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrodeatacama-26.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle we have is from Entre Olivios, a small artisanal company in Mendoza. During a wine tasting day in we stumbled into the tasting room, first trying olives and jams before moving on the liqueurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Licor De Cerveza was the best of the bunch so we took a bottle to be consumed at a later date.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle travelled with us on a 36 hour bus journey to San Pedro De Atacama where we drank the bottle watching the sunset in the desert landscape of the Valle de Luna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/liqor-de-cerveza-sunset-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The liquor is finely crafted from whiskey, beer, sugar and honey. Giving a unique flavour. We have no idea how strong it is but it leaves a nice warm burning sensation in your stomach. Perfect for warming you up in the desert when the sun has gone down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/sanpedrodeatacama-27.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flavour of the honey and sugar is strong and overpowers the beer and whiskey leaving a distinct heavenly taste. Despite its fiery after taste it leaves you wanting more, which is a shame because it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely we will be ever be able to try it again.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;Licor De Cerveza probably translates to Beer Liquor which when translated sounds less appealing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Uruguayan Beer</Title>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;So the beer costs more per litre than a bottle of good Uruguayan Red wine. You would expect it to be good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Patricia Beer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This typical Uruguayan beer is clean and crisp with a golden colour and fair taste. Great with Uruguay&amp;rsquo;s famous barbequed beef.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/patricia-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pilsen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could do worse than this Uruguayan beer, hardly amazing but did the job while walking along Uruguay&amp;rsquo;s famous coastline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/pilsen-can-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zillertal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty decent Christmas day drink on the beach, tastes a bit like Heineken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/zillerta-2-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first country where I have nominally chosen to drink red wine over beer. Could these lacklustre beers put me off beer for good?&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Driving into Heaven Salar De Uyuni -  Day 3</Title>
    <TitleURL>bolivia/salar-de-uyuni/driving-into-heaven-salar-de-uyuni-day-3</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-02-21T15:21:02.17+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Today was the day we had been waiting for, the pinnacle of the tour and the reason we had been stuck in the back of a jeep for the past few days. Just when we couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait to get out on to the salt flats the driver stops so we can check out some giant cactuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/salardeuyuni-2.jpg" alt="giant cactus at salar de uyuni"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Edge of the Salt Flat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we approach the salt flats we worry about how far we can go, there were thunder storms last night and it rained heavily. February is in the wet season and the salt flats are flooded. If the water is too deep it is impossible to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our 4x4 stops a little way in to the salt flats and we all get out, the water on the flats is barely a centre metre deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/salardeuyuni-5.jpg" alt="Salt Flat Jeep in water"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Already this place is amazing and it&amp;rsquo;s time for everybody to take the obligatory perspective altering photographs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leanne has me right where she wants, in the palm of her hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/salardeuyuni-8.jpg" alt="Salt Flats in palm of hand"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I know she&amp;rsquo;s no match for me when I&amp;rsquo;m hungry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/salardeuyuni-10.jpg" alt="Karl eats Leanne at Salar De uyuni"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it&amp;rsquo;s absolutely amazing I still can&amp;rsquo;t wait to head out deep into the middle of the flats. We are still close to the surrounding mountains and it&amp;rsquo;s hard to get a feel for the enormity of the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/salardeuyuni-20.jpg" alt="Salar De uyuni group photo"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But perhaps this would be&amp;nbsp;as far as we would go, we still hoped the water level would be low enough to allow us to pass through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Middle of the Dry Salt Flats&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly the jeeps headed out into the vast expanse which is the Solar de Uyuni, at 10,000 square kilometres it&amp;rsquo;s actually so big that it can be seen from space and it is used by Nasa as a means to configure their satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/salardeuyuni-31.jpg" alt="salar de uyuni salt landscape"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We stopped at a dry point where the full vastness of the salt landscape could really be appreciated. In every direction there was white salt, only ending where it met the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we took the opportunity to kick some dinosaur arse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/salardeuyuni-25.jpg" alt="salar de uyuni dinosaur fight"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And felt like making humans look very small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/salardeuyuni-35.jpg" alt="salar de uyuni in palm of hand slat flats"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We sat in the salt and ate lunch in the most spectacular setting possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/salardeuyuni-37.jpg" alt="Lunch in Salar de uyuni slat flats"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wet Salt Flats and Driving Into Heaven&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just when we thought it could not get much better we journeyed far into the never-ending horizon. The water splashing around the jeeps got deeper and we slowed to a crawling pace. Then, gazing out of the window, appeared scenery so spectacular there was no other word to describe it but heavenly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/salardeuyuni-45.jpg" alt="jeep in the sky salt flats"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sky and earth merged into one, the horizon between land and sky blurred to produce the effect of floating through the clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/salardeuyuni-63.jpg" alt="reflections in the sky"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The awe-inspiring reflections created a feeling of tranquillity and other worldly presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/salardeuyuni-50.jpg" alt="yoga in the sky salt flats wet"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We stepped out of the vehicle and the salt flat was layered with 10cm of warm salty water, each step we took produced ripples far into the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/salardeuyuni-58.jpg" alt="kissing in the sky wet salt flats"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the ripples ceased the whole world became perfectly still, the ground became sky, and the sky became the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/salardeuyuni-62.jpg" alt="reflections in the sky wet salt flats"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fading light, edging though the cloudy sky, created a dream like landscape, beyond the scope of imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/salardeuyuni-57.jpg" alt="yoga in the sky salar de uyuni"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a doubt this was the most beautiful place on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/salardeuyuni-67.jpg" alt="salar de uyuni people and jeeps reflections"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, it is unlikely it will remain the same in the future. It&amp;rsquo;s estimated that 70% of the world&amp;rsquo;s lithium is held in the salt flats. Lithium is an essential ingredient in the production of batteries for electric cars. In a few years this vast resource has the potential to change Bolivia from poverty stricken to the Saudi Arabia of South America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Salt Hotel and Train Graveyard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got back into the jeeps and wondered in amazement, gazing at the awe inspiring beauty out of the window. Then, an hour later, slowly growing in the distance appeared a salt hotel, the magical feeling soon subsided when hundreds of other jeeps arrived carrying tourists on day trips spoiling the tranquil effect. A swift visit to the salt hotel and we left, making our way to Uyuni where our final stop was a rather gloomy looking train graveyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/traingraveyard-1.jpg" alt="uyuni train graveyard wet and gloomy"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rain that made the salt flats so beautiful dampened the mood as I dirtied myself climbing on the wet and rusty trains. Cold and wet we hastily headed back to Uyuni, drawing a line on another amazing chapter on this crazy adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Lake Titicaca -  Copacabana</Title>
    <TitleURL>bolivia/travel/lake-titicaca-copacabana</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-02-21T18:34:08.393+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Set on the tranquil shores of Lake Titicaca, Copacabana is a far cry from the chaotic city off La Paz. This popular holiday destination is the main town on the Bolivian side of the lake and a good base to visit Isla del sol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/copacabana-11.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we wondered around town you can&amp;rsquo;t help but see the grand 1619 cathedral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/copacabana-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the most revered holy sites in Bolivia as it houses the &amp;ldquo;La Virgen de la Candelaria&amp;rdquo; which is said to have magical healing powers. The town itself has seen holy pilgrims come and go for centuries which attributes to the huge range of hotels and guesthouses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/copacabana-19.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nowadays Copacabana is as much a tourist resort as pilgrimage site, with peddle boats for hire and woman in traditional Bolivian dress selling photos with baby Llamas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/copacabana-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Climbing Cerro Calvario at sunset gives you great views of the town, though the high altitude can make it tough going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/copacabana-14.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though we took the difficult route up, following a dirt path up the side of the mountain. There was an easy paved path back down, packed with prayer and offering spots for pilgrims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/copacabana-15.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other side of town there is another hill with an ancient Inca Astronomical observatory. There is a small charge for walking up where you get good views of the town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/copacabana-22.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The observatory is a plinth placed across two rocks, in similar vain to Stone Henge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/copacabana-23.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Copacabana was a relaxing place to just chill and spend a few days as well as a good place to leave our baggage as we made our way to the most famous site on the lake, Isla Del Sol&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Hiking a Sacred Inca Island - Isla del Sol to Copacabana</Title>
    <TitleURL>bolivia/travel/hiking-a-sacred-inca-island-isla-del-sol-to-copacabana</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-02-21T18:35:58.937+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Island of the sun, or lack of, as was the case for us when we woke up early to catch the boat from Copacabana only to see dark clouds on the horizon. Nevertheless, we decided to be optimistic and hoped that the island would live up to its name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isladelsol-9.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surely enough as we boarded the overcrowded boat the clouds began to part, which momentarily stopped me thinking about the lack of sufficient life jackets on board. After an uncomfortable two hour journey we arrived at the northern part of the island. The island itself is situated within Lake Titicaca and many say the island is the highlight of the area. Once a sacred part of the Inca empire the island is now a pilgrimage for tourists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isladelsol-26.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, with blue skies and the sun shining down we could see why people say this.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a tent you can camp on the beach filled with backpackers and join in the party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isladelsol-3.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly without a tent we decided to spend our day hiking around the island. Along with the amazing scenery there are also several pre Columbian ruins dotted around. The most impressive is the Chicana Ruins and the near by sacraficial table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isladelsol-16.jpg" alt="chiana ruins isla del sol"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isladelsol-12.jpg" alt="isla dle sol sacraficial table"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next we headed along the path toward the southern end of the island. This is a beautiful walk but at an altitude of 3800 meters the hills feel like mountains when climbing up them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isladelsol-20.jpg" alt="isla del sol main walk"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We spent the night in a hotel in the small village of Yumani and had to catch the compulsory sunset shot. The village lacks running water and the descendents of the ancient Uro culture still own and farm the surrounding land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isladelsol-30.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hiking From Isla Del Sol to Copabana&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning we had two options. We could either catch the boat straight back to Copacabana or, alternatively, we could head over to the mainland village of Yampupata and walk the 18km along the lake to reach Copacabana by foot. We decided to head down to the harbour to see what boats were leaving. After a short discussion with the locals we managed to charter a boat to take us to Yampupata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/islasoltocopacabana-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, despite being tired from yesterday&amp;rsquo;s high altitude hiking, it was settled that we were in for another day of rambling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/islasoltocopacabana-2.jpg" alt="yamputa harbour"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all started well enough as we passed through small local villages we walked along flat roads and were able to see what life is like in Bolivia outside the tourist hubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/islasoltocopacabana-5.jpg" alt="yamputa sheep herder"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the roads turned steeper and as I struggled to breath I questioned why we didn&amp;rsquo;t just get the boat straight back to Copacabana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/islasoltocopacabana-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we powered on and the road started to wind down hill as we took a short cut along an old Inca road where pilgrims once walked on their way to the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/islasoltocopacabana-17.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For once I was glad that Karl had made friends with a local stray dog as it protected us from the many dogs which tried to attack us when passing their farms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/islasoltocopacabana-13.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dogs weren&amp;rsquo;t our only danger. As I walked along, peacefully letting my mind wander, I looked down and what I thought was a stick started moving by my foot. I realised soon enough that it was in fact a snake. I was so shocked that I had almost stood on it that I may have screamed and ran away slightly more dramatically than I would have liked. So much so that I managed to attract the attention of a local Bolivian woman, who, when I told her it was a serpent went over and proceeded to bash it on the head with a rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/islasoltocopacabana-14.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further along the path we passed some beautiful floating islands made of reeds. These aren&amp;rsquo;t as impressive as the ones on the Peru side but were a perfect place to stop for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/islasoltocopacabana-18.jpg" alt="floating islands copacabana"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ordered trout, the local speciality. There were hundreds of them swimming in the nets by the islands. Our fisherman come chef simply grabbed two from the lake, gutted them, cut them in half, fried them and had them on our plates in minutes. It was delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/islasoltocopacabana-22.jpg" alt="troucha"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last section was an easy 3km back to the town, where, along with our stray dog, we also befriended some of the local school children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/islasoltocopacabana-29.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the Isla del Sol and the walk back to Copacabana were two excellent days where we really felt we got to see a different side to Bolivia.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;Island of the sun, or lack of, as was the case for us when we woke up early to catch the boat from Copacabana only to see dark clouds on the horizon. Nevertheless, we decided to be optimistic and hoped that the island would live up to its name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/isladelsol-9.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Cusco, Guinea Pigs and the Shaman of the Sacred Valley </Title>
    <TitleURL>peru/travel/cusco-guinea-pigs-and-the-shaman-of-the-sacred-valley</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-02-27T16:30:13.35+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;We made it to Peru, our final South American country. Our first stop was the tourist hub, Cusco. The city is popular due to its close-ish proximity to Machu Picchu and the many ruins in the Sacred Valley. However, as we soon found out, the city itself has its own charms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/cuscoandmachupichu-11.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful plazas, cobbled streets, grand churches and stunning green mountains make this a perfect base to spend a few days exploring the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/cuscoandmachupichu-5.jpg" alt="cusco plaza de armas"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had been particularly looking forward to Peru as many other travellers have commented that the food in Peru is the best in South America. We have failed to be impressed with the cuisine in the continent so far and were desperately in need of some flavoursome foods. Luckily for us we found a market selling local dishes and sat down to see what was on offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/cuscoandmachupichu-10.jpg" alt="empanada oven"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plates were piled high and our basic Spanish couldn&amp;rsquo;t translate everything on the menu. One thing we didn&amp;rsquo;t fail to spot on the grill was the local delicacy &amp;ldquo;Cuy&amp;rdquo;, or as it is known in English, Guinea Pig. These furry creatures are not kept for pets in this country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/cuscoandmachupichu-1.jpg" alt="guinea pigs cooked whole"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keen to try new things we ordered a plate and tucked in. Not knowing exactly what we were eating the strange mixtures of strong flavours and bazar combination of textures left us less than impressed. We later found out our plate consisted of chicken, guinea pig, sausage, cheese, spinach fritters, seaweed, tripe, fish eggs, corn, peppers and salt. It says a lot when Karl commented that the best thing on the plate was the guinea pigs kidney. I can&amp;rsquo;t say I will be rushing to try it again any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/cuscoandmachupichu-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We spent the rest of our days in Cusco exploring the historic centre of San Blas and visiting some of the local sites including the conservative Inca museum and the ruins of Qorikanca.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/cuscoandmachupichu-9.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Machu Picchu is by far the star attraction of the area we were also surprised to see a new booming tourist industry. Travellers from far and wide descend to Cusco and the surrounding Scared Valley to experience Ayahuasca, the potent hallucinogenic drug derived from the roots of plants found in the local mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/cuscoandmachupichu-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ayahuasca has been used by the local Shaman in Peru for centuries, however the more enterprising ones have now marketed it to backpacking hippies and recreational drug users from around the world who are keen to try this new and mystical experience. Everything from week long programmes to one night ceremonies can be found on sale, some costing hundreds of dollars. Speaking to a few travellers who had experienced the ceremonies it seems that most take place in purpose built &amp;ldquo;temples&amp;rdquo; the Shaman is more likely to be a westerner than one of the local tribes&amp;rsquo; people and it will usually involve a lot of music and a lot of sick, as each person is provided with their own bucket for &amp;ldquo;purging&amp;rdquo;. Despite the clear commercialisation of the traditional ceremony many come back with positive experiences. It seems that if you are looking for a more alternative experience then this is the place to go.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Machu Picchu Pissed</Title>
    <TitleURL>peru/travel/machu-picchu-pissed</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-02-27T16:33:18.543+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s right, we have invented a new term for getting sloshed, and here is the story behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Machu Picchu is named as one of the &amp;ldquo;7 Wonders of the World&amp;rdquo;, we don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily agree with this term as we have found many more amazing sites than those on the list. Nevertheless, we knew it was an incredible place to visit and could not miss the opportunity to see this ancient Inca village set in the lush Andean mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/cuscoandmachupichu-29.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One important bit of information any visitor needs to know when deciding to visit Machu Picchu is that it is not an easy place to get to. You need to decide upon one of the following options;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Follow the Inca Trail - This is a popular 3 day trek taking you along the old Inca road. As it is extremely popular and the number of people doing the route at any one time is limited, it needs to be booked in advance and can cost hundreds of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Follow an &amp;ldquo;alternative&amp;rdquo; Inca trail - There are in fact many different Inca roads leading to Machu Picchu so for those who don&amp;rsquo;t mind not doing the famous route there are more strenuous and adventurous options available ranging from 3 to 5 day excursions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Get a train - There are no roads leading to Aguas Calientes, the closest town to Machu Picchu, however there are trains which can get you there in comfort and even luxury. However, with a return ticket costing anywhere from US$100-300pp not including the entrance ticket, this is by far the most expensive option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Bus and walk - Many tour operators in Cusco offer to bus you to the end of the road near the hydro- electric plant from there it is a 3 hour walk along the railway tracks to Aguas Calientes. A two day tour including bus, one night accommodation, meals and entrance to Machu Picchu costs US$80-$100. You can choose to do this yourself using local busses and collectivos which could work out cheaper. This is by far the most economical way to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite these many options we had a few problems. Firstly, we arrived in Cusco in February when the Inca Trail is closed. We had also failed to book in advance so this would not be option for us anyway. Secondly, we had arrived in the rainy season and it bucketed it down every day we were in Cusco. Because of this many tour operators weren&amp;rsquo;t offering the alternative walks and the prospect of spending three days trekking in the rain and mud didn&amp;rsquo;t seem like an appealing option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This left us with either the expensive train or bus option. Trying to look after our pennies we decided to go for option 4 and booked this through a reputable agency for $87.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/cuscoandmachupichu-32.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the day of our departure we arrived at our pick up point at 7.30am only to find the lady who we had booked the tour through frantically running around. Something was clearly going wrong. We managed to decipher from her that, due to the torrential rains, there had been a mud slide on the road, busses were stuck and there was no way of getting us there by car today or potentially for the next few days. We were devastated but, as we have learnt to accept during this trip, there is nothing you can do about the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After discussing the options it became apparent that the only way we would be able to be certain of getting to Machu Picchu was to take the train the next day. We worked out a deal and ended up having to pay an additional US$115. That would be a total of US$289 to get us there! I was less than impressed but knew it would cost a hell of a lot more to return to Peru at some point in the future so we reluctantly forked out the cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next problem was getting the train tickets as with everyone now wanting to get the train we had to rush to the ticket office to make sure we could get the cheaper seats. The other premium services would have cost us hundreds of dollars more. Anxiously we booked our train leaving Ollantaytambo at 6.10am and returning from Aguas Calientes at 9.50pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day the bus came to pick us up from our hotel at the ungodly hour of 3am. Excited to be finally getting there we jumped on the bus and tried, but mainly failed, to get some sleep as the bus jolted its way over bumps and around corners. Soon enough it was 6am and we had 10 minutes to jump on the train. Trying hard to stay dry as the rain came pouring down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/cuscoandmachupichu-14.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next mode of transport was more pleasant. On the 2 hour train journey we were provided with coffee and biscuits. The least they could do given the extortionate prices they charge! Anyway, we arrived in Aguas Calientes at around 8am and were met by a guide who ushered us onto another bus which took us on a 20min journey uphill. The rain had stopped and the clouds were parting. We couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait to get inside. However, our guide had other ideas. He had us wait for over an hour as he herded people together. After waiting another 10 minutes for him to make order out of the chaos we decided to split from the group and explore on our own. Machu Picchu is famous for being mysterious as there is a lot still unknown so we figured the scatty guide wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to tell us anything that we hadn&amp;rsquo;t already read in our guide books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally inside we were able to see the in real life the site so famous to anyone with an interest in history and travel. For me, as I have seen the image a thousand times, it felt familiar, like I had been there before. It is nothing short of spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were disappointed to find out we had to have purchased another ticket to climb the peaks Huayna Wayna or Machu Pichu Mountain. So we made do with a less strenuous walk to the Sun Gate, which also provided spectacular views as the path clung to the mountainside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/cuscoandmachupichu-23.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without doing either of the larger hikes the site was easily explored in a few hours and we were exhausted from our early start. We decided to go back to Aguas Calientes but arrived there at 2pm and our train wasn&amp;rsquo;t until 9.50, with many hours to kill we looked for something to do in town and were immediately lured into a bar with their 4 for 1 drinks offer. Many, many pisco sours later and in quite a drunken state we ended up franticly running for the train. We arrived back in Cusco exhausted at 3am the next day. A full 24 hours after we set off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were well and truly Machu Picchu Pissed!&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Three Days Exploring the Epic Colca Canyon</Title>
    <TitleURL>peru/walking-and-trekking/three-days-exploring-the-epic-colca-canyon</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-03-02T22:40:18.167+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Colca Canyon is the second deepest canyon in world and is a popular hiking destination in Peru. Often passed over by tourists in favour of the world famous Inca trail. We originally planned on doing this trek self-guided but costing only &amp;pound;60 for a 3 day guided tour with transport, food and accommodation it hardly seemed worth the extra effort. As we refused to pay the extortionate US$500 plus prices to walk the Inca trail this unique canyon trek, passing through Peruvian villages that pre date Incan civilization, made a worthy alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/colcacanyon-3.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We left Arequipa at 3am and took a 6 hour cramped bus ride across the Andean Plateau and arrived in Chivay for breakfast before making a move to the Cruz del Condor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cruz Del Condors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The early start was worth it as we gazed through the early morning sun into the depth of the canyon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide said we would be lucky to see the Giant Andean Condors as it&amp;rsquo;s not the right season but as we looked down into the canyon there were two condors soaring up and they flew straight over our heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/colcacanyon-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second in size only to the albatross, these magnificent birds gracefully fly whilst barely ever flapping their wings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/colcacanyon-4.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Into The Canyon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then took the bus to the edge of the canyon trail and met the rest of hiking group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/colcacanyon-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually we are disappointed at this stage when suddenly twenty other people appear. However this time we were wrong as we were introduced to an Australian couple who would be our only two hiking buddy&amp;rsquo;s for the next three days and as it turned out we had quite a lot in common. They both quit their jobs to travel the Americas but unlike us who are eventually heading to Australia they were going to London to look for work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/colcacanyon-27.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took around 3 gentle hours to descend the canyon and get to our first village where a multitude of fruit trees grew in abundance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/colcacanyon-9.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The village was small and basic, our room had no electricity, no light or bathroom. In fact it was a bed surrounded by four mud walls. For tea we ate soup, llama and rice. Afterwards we sat staring up at the magnificent canyon while the sun set, casting a kaleidoscope of changing colours on the canyon walls. The area was so relaxing that we had no problem getting to sleep after a long week of early starts and late nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/colcacanyon-19.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day we picked up the trail again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/colcacanyon-23.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We arrived at a make shift stall, there were guinea pigs on the menu, being curious I Iooked around the back and there they all were. Three cages of the furry creatures waiting to be slaughtered. The lone black one had a special fate. The black colour is the thought to be special which means that it can be used as a sacrifice to the god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/colcacanyon-25.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We stuck to the local fruit instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/colcacanyon-14.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2-3 hours of gentle walking we came to the &amp;lsquo;Oasis&amp;rsquo; which looked like a paradise among the dry canyon rocks. Fed by water from a nearby volcano it truly deserves its namesake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Oasis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/colcacanyon-34.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in gardens of colourful flowers and cool swimming pools it is an amazing place to relax, while the day away and forget all your worries. Like a Garden of Eden amongst the baron and inhospitable rocks. Life just doesn&amp;rsquo;t get more relaxing than this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/colcacanyon-36.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day we woke at 4.45AM and without any breakfast we set off on the 1300m trek out of the canyon. Some found it hard, some found it easy, and some rode a donkey. With all the trekking we have been doing recently we found it easy taking just over two hours to get to the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/colcacanyon-39.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we waited for the rest of our group to climb out of the canyon the lack of breakfast was taking its toll. When an hour or two later we made it to the &amp;lsquo;disco breakfast&amp;rsquo; bar. Fitted with flashing disco lights and 90s pop tunes I was not ashamed to order two breakfasts at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/colcacanyon-42.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next stop was the hot springs, basically a warm outdoor swimming pool were someone could piss next to you and you would never feel it. It seems that every tour deems it necessary to add in a &amp;ldquo;hot springs&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s already 30 degrees and there&amp;rsquo;s no need for more heat. Drinking a cold beer was a much better option!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lunch was a tasty Peruvian buffet. Even after the breakfast my hunger knew no bounds. After three days of small portions of rice and vegetables even the llamas outside were getting scared of being eaten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/colcacanyon-51.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four plates later and a pile of deserts and it was time to view the fertile canyon valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/colcacanyon-48.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final stop on the tour, at 4900m, was the volcano lookout. Unfortunately as the weather had turned, all we could see was fog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so ended one of the better guided trips we have taken. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure we could have walked the entire circuit in a single day. Most people opt to do it in two days but I&amp;rsquo;m glad we took the three days to spend as much time as we could in the canyon. We left not with sore legs but a great feeling of tranquillity and peacefulness taken from the great canyon itself.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;Colca Canyon is the second deepest canyon in world and is a popular hiking destination in Peru. Often passed over by tourists in favour of the world famous Inca trail. We originally planned on doing this trek self-guided but costing only &amp;pound;60 for a 3 day guided tour with transport, food and accommodation it hardly seemed worth the extra effort. As we refused to pay the extortionate US$500...</ContentPreview>

    <Title>Cooking Traditional Peruvian Food in Arequipa</Title>
    <TitleURL>peru/travel/cooking-traditional-peruvian-food-in-arequipa</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-03-02T22:40:56.06+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Peruvian cooking has been critically acclaimed worldwide for its mix of eclectic flavours. It absorbs culinary ideas from around the world, combining Asian, North American, French and of course Spanish flavours as well as local cuisine which includes over 3000 varieties of potatoes and dozens of different kinds of corn. Beyond the roasted guinea pig and juicy alpaca steaks there really is a dazzling array of food available making this the top foodie destination in South America. So when we arrived in Arequipa we decided to find out some of the secrets behind the hype and take a Peruvian cooking class known as the Peruvian Cooking Experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/arequpia-1.jpg" alt="arequipa cathedral"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We turned up as the sun was shining to a nicely gardened hotel and were directed to an&amp;nbsp;open air kitchen occupying the back of the garden.The menu for the day was the traditional Peruvian dishes of Causa and Lomo Saltado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Causa&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/arequipa-and-cooking-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the potato mix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;1kg potatoes (yellow potato if available)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;4 tbsp yellow chili paste&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;&amp;frac12; cup vegetable oil (olive oil not recommended)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Juice 1 or 2 key lime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;1 can of tuna-fish packed in oil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;&amp;frac12; onion, chopped in little blocks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;1 tomato chopped like the onions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;1 cup mayonnaise softened with milk or oil (not thick)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;1 avocado&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Chopped fresh parsley&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Salt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Round metal moulds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boil the potatoes in salted water. Peel and mash with hands while still hot (enough to handle). Mix thoroughly with the yellow chili (better if peruvian amarillo paste) and lime juice. add oil on requirement (not dry, needs to be like a mass) Salt to taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/arequipa-and-cooking-4.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use the tuna fish without the oil. Mix the tuna with the chopped onions and mayonnaise. Peel the avocado and cut thin slices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/arequipa-and-cooking-5.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Place a thin layer of the potato mash in the metal mould previously oiled. Place the avocado slices on a serving dish, and spread with a thin film of mayonnaise. Lay the avocado slices on the first layer of potato mash. If too dry, add a little of the mayonnaise. Spread a second layer of potato mash, and cover with the tuna preparation. Cover with a last layer of potatoes, and decorated with slices of hard boiled eggs and black olives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/arequipa-and-cooking-7.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: try variations of the filling using (instead of tuna) crab-meat, shrimps, octopus in olive, or (for vegetarians) plain tomato slices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/arequipa-and-cooking-9.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leannes is the better looking one on the left, I just couldnt waste the extra chicken salad in favour of looks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Lomo Saltado&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/arequipa-and-cooking-18.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;1 pound beef (tenderloin if possible), sliced ? to &amp;frac14; inch not thin strips ( thin will be dry).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;2 red onions, peeled and sliced into thick stripes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;2 tomatoes sliced in thick stripes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;1 or 2 yellow chili pepper (Peruvian aji amarillo) cuin thin stripes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;vegetable oil to fry as needed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;garlic paste&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Soy sauce, vinegar,beef broth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Salt ,Pepper, cumin, dried oregano.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;French Fries 1 package (1 lb )&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Pisco or brandy (1/2 cup)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Prepare French Fries and set them aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. In a bowl marinate the meat with salt, pepper and little cumin. Add the soy sauce. Set aside for 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a frying pan (medium-high heat). Add a spoonful of garlic. Cook for 1 minute. Add a portion of meat (we will cook per portion). Fry meat until juices begin to release. Continuously move the pan (Sautee technique).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/arequipa-and-cooking-13.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a portion of onions until they are halfway transparent. Stir in the tomatoes and the yellow pepper. Cook until the tomatoes soften. Pour in a spoonful of soy sauce and &amp;frac12; ounce of brandy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/arequipa-and-cooking-14.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cover and cook until beef is done. If preparation is too dry add 1 spoonful of vinegar or 2 spoons of beef broth. Season to taste with salt, pepper and cumin. Sprinkle with chopped parsley to serve. Repeat process for each other portion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/arequipa-and-cooking-15.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serve with white rice or quinoa. Put the French Fries next to the meat (you can also mix them with the meat while finishing cooking it)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We really enjoyed the whole Peruvian Cooking Experience and picked up some new cooking techniques to take back home. We also learned Leanne is scared of fire so we might give this one a miss when we are home, for fear of burning the house down.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Climbing Chachani - Our near death experiences </Title>
    <TitleURL>peru/travel/climbing-chachani-our-near-death-experiences</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-03-02T22:42:29.147+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Karl had got it into his head that he wanted to climb a 6,000m mountain whilst in South America. I was less keen. I had reached 5,645m in the Himalayas when I summited Kalla Patthar a few years earlier. I still had the memories of how hard it was. I had struggled with altitude sickness making me almost black out, mixed with the painfully cold winds had meant that to get to the summit took every last inch of my willpower and energy. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know if I could put my body through that again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/chachani-4.jpg" alt="chachani volcano"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The selling point of Chachani is that it is one of the easiest 6,000m mountains to summit. In fact you pretty much drive most of the way up. The car leaves you at around 5,100m you then walk for a few hours and camp at 5,300 before setting off at night to reach the summit and come back down. We were also well acclimatised as we had been travelling in Bolivia and Peru in altitudes over 3,000m for over 3 weeks. With all the hiking we had been doing lately this really was the optimum time for us to take on the challenge. So, hesitantly, I signed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/chachani-15.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the day came I became more excited. Karl kept saying how easy it was going to be. I strongly disagreed, knowing exactly how hard it was going to be, but I was feeling up to the challenge. We set off with the guide to get kitted out with the correct gear. It seemed like a good company to do the trek with and the equipment they give us looked ok. We also met the other couple who would be doing the walk with us. They were from Brazil and had never climbed a mountain before or been at high altitude. I wrote them off completely, doubting they would even make it to base camp. However, as the car drove us up to 5,100m everyone in the group seemed in good spirits and no one showed signs of altitude sickness. Maybe I would be wrong about the Brazilians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/chachani-11.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first part of the trek was the one I was least looking forward to as we had to carry our big bags with camping gear, water and food. Thankfully, my condition of doing the trek was that Karl would carry most of the ten litres of water. The walk itself was easy enough with only a gradual incline and a few sections with difficult rocks to climb over. However, it was made much more difficult due to our heavy loads and the now quite obvious, lack of oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/chachani-21.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guide kept a slow and steady pace with regular breaks and we all managed to get to base camp. If anything, I was the one who struggled the most lugging my bag over the rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/chachani-33.jpg" alt="chachani base camp"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ate dinner and watched the sun set over the mountains which was magical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/chachani-38.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as the sun disappeared over the horizon the temperature dropped. We quickly ate our food and went to bed in an attempt to get some sleep before our 1am start. I must have been tired from the walk as I slept really well, however when the guide woke us Karl and the Brazilians had only little or no sleep at all. Nevertheless, with several layers of clothing to fight off the cold we all set off at a slow pace zigzagging up the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/chachani-48.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first hour and a half I was surprised at how easy I was finding it and I started to believe that we would all make it to the top without any problems. Then the path got steeper and as we approached 5,500m the air was getting thinner. I looked behind and saw the Brazilians lagging. When we stopped for a quick break they asked how much longer it was to the summit. The guide said about 3-4 hours. I looked at the Brazilians guys&amp;rsquo; face which was now turning an odd shade of grey. Feeling Ill they decided to head back down. With no acclimatisation or mountaineering experience I was impressed they had got that far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/chachani-50.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me and Karl ploughed on and reached the snow line. At this time of year there was a thick layer of hard, compact snow and ice at the top so we were required to wear crampons. I had only wore them once before and they didn&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable on my feet. They were loose and kept snagging. But slowly I got used to them and we edged further up the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/chachani-57.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Karl started to complain of feeling sick, he had mentioned it a few times before but was now starting to retch. The guide suggested sticking his finger down his throat. He was sick but it didn&amp;rsquo;t get rid of the nausea. After a few hours it eventually got to the point where he couldn&amp;rsquo;t walk five steps without stopping to be sick. At around 5,850m he decided to go down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/chachani-58.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, I was feeling fine, after all my worrying the altitude wasn&amp;rsquo;t effecting me, apart from making me breathless, and I was warm enough to feel my fingers and toes. The guide said we should carry on to the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/chachani-59.jpg" alt="chachani summiting"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting to the summit was difficult and I had to stop every 20 steps to catch my breath. There was one precarious bit where the guide said people had fallen but we made it over ok. Then, pushing myself to the limit, I managed to make the final steps to the top and collapsed onto my knees wishing Karl was with me to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/chachani-70.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The view was outstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/chachani-65.jpg" alt="top of chachani"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/chachani-64.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt on top of the world and couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe that I was the one out of the group to make it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/chachani-74.jpg" alt="chachani top"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After few moments to take it all in we started to descend. The guide said it would be easier and quicker to go another way down. I was exhausted and followed him as he quickly paced down the mountain. Then things went disastrously wrong. We reached a steep section where there was no clear path. I&amp;rsquo;m still not entirely sure what happened as it came about so quickly, but it seems I may have tripped as my crampons snagged and fell down onto the snow and continued to slide down the mountain. It was utterly terrifying. I saw the guide ahead as he stood like a goal keeper trying to catch me but I just ploughed him down as well. I continued to fall and could only see rocks ahead. Not knowing how I was going to stop I honestly thought I would die. I bounced, like a pin ball, off a few rocks and then eventually it plateaued out and I managed to slow down enough to grab onto a rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lay there for a few moments in shock before checking all my limbs were working. I was relieved to find I could move everything but I banged my head and could see blood pouring into the snow so I was still concerned. The guide came running down to see if I was ok. He was also in quite a state as when he tried to catch me my crampon had dug into his knee and he had a nasty wound, he also broke his finger as he was holding onto one of the poles which bent backwards as I fell into it. Overall, it seemed he had come off worse than me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to walk we didn&amp;rsquo;t warrant a helicopter so after the bleeding had stopped and we cleaned ourselves up we had to continue walking down the mountain. I was now terrified to walk on the snow so with much caution we slowly got below the snow level. I started to feel faint and sick so we had to stop a few times. Once the shock wore off the pain begin to kick in. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed it much before but now as we were walking down my right shoulder and knee were excruciatingly painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We finally go to an area where we could see camp and I could see Karl happily waving up at us not having a clue what we had just been through. Taking it slowly, as each step now caused considerable pain we did eventually make it back to camp. The Brazilians and Karl didn&amp;rsquo;t look healthy themselves however when they saw what happened they came rushing to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karl, despite being ill, was now forced to pack up camp and carry both mine and his bags back to the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/chachani-82.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last stretch back was like the obstacle course of pain and I was elated to finally reach the car. &lt;br /&gt;We made it back to Arequipa at 5pm, I was still in pain but the bleeding to my head had stopped and I was pretty sure nothing was broken. All I wanted was a shower and to sleep. We decided not to go to the hospital but in the morning as I was still in a lot of pain we decided it was best to get checked out. The x-ray showed that there was no broken bones I just had muscle damage to my shoulder which needed to be put in a sling and a few cuts and bruises which needed to be looked after. Overall I was extremely lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/chachani-83.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We took on Chachani but in the end the mountain beat us. Reaching 6,000m was an amazing challenge but one which II won&amp;rsquo;t be repeating anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;Karl had got it into his head that he wanted to climb a 6,000m mountain whilst in South America. I was less keen. I had reached 5,645m in the Himalayas when I summited Kalla Patthar a few years earlier. I still had the memories of how hard it was. I had struggled with altitude sickness making me almost black out, mixed with the painfully cold winds had meant that to get to the summit took ever...</ContentPreview>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Bolivia is a country with a seemingly unhealthy addiction to Coca leaves. With this in mind it was no surprise when we spotted this coca infused soft drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/cocandina-1.jpg" alt="cocandina two cans"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not have alcohol in but it is recommended not to drink too many. We decided to give it a try for research purposes and found it to be quite nice and incredibly sweet. It didn&amp;rsquo;t have too much of the bitter taste you get when chewing the leaves, the sugar seemed to overpower the actual coca flavour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/cocandina-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of stimulating effect it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too impressive. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for something to wake you up we would recommend sticking to Red Bull.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Pisco is the drink of Peru..or Chile, depends which country you are in as each claim it was their own. Whatever the case this distilled wine is found all over both countries. Bottles are sold in a wide range of varieties such as pure, aromatic and blended and are generally 30-40% proof&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/piscosours-1.jpg" alt="pisco sours glass"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;The most popular way to drink the pisco is in a cocktail known as Pisco Sours. This is made using freshly squeezed lemon juice an egg white, pisco and sugar or syrup, all mixed in a blender. It is often garnished with a sprinkling of coco powder and a slice of lime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/piscosours-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sour citrus flavours are overwhelmingly refreshing and we both agree that it is one of our favourite drinks we have tasted so far on our journey. However, proceed with caution, these are very easy to drink and, as we found out on our trip to Machu Picchu, you can end up in a rather messy state.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>A Quick Romp in Romania - Bucharest</Title>
    <TitleURL>romania/travel/a-quick-romp-in-romania-bucharest</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-04-02T11:44:26.34+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;As we stepped off the plane into Romania I was expecting no one to be there. The British press often claimed that the Romanians were all making their way to England. Judging by the amount of people around, it seems this may have been slightly exaggerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/romania-19.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We walked outside the airport and were unable to see any of the famous Gypsys with their horse&amp;rsquo;s and carts so instead took a taxi to the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything we knew of Romania came through the news and we were ready to be shown and different side. After years of communist repression the future changed after the breakup of the Soviet Union in December 1989 when Romania became a democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/romania-15.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Romania is now part of the EU and it&amp;rsquo;s not hard to see why. As we walk around the capital Bucharest it feels much more European than expected. With most memories of the old communist regime now destroyed. There are many European cars being driven, BMW, Audi, Renaults, VW&amp;rsquo;s and of course the Romanian favourite Dacias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/romania-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We go for lunch at the beautiful restaurant Caru cu bere. This is Bucharest&amp;rsquo;s oldest beer house and has the fine ornate interior to match, the carved wood and stain glass windows create an amazing setting. The traditional Romanian food is very much German inspired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sausage, Mashed Potato and Mustard with Sauerkraut side&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/romania-7.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pork neck fillet with cabbage salad and rice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/romania-8.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the beer comes in steins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/romania-5.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the language is Latin based, many of the words are the same in Spanish, French and Italian. Most people we meet speak some English. I was expecting it to be more Russian but this doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the architecture is very much European&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/romania-20.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that remains of the old regime is the Palace of Parliament, created by the former dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. It is the second largest building in the world after the Pentagon, has over 3000 rooms and is estimated to have cost over 3 billion euros to build, despite its monstrous look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/romania-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We spent the afternoon wandering the old town with its newly renovated and lively bar and restaurant scene before having an early night in preparation for our trip to Transylvania. Taking the time to pass the statue of the so called real Dracula, Vlad Tepes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/romania-16.jpg" alt="vlad the impaler statue bucherest"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our time in Bucharest was short and sweet, but pleasantly surprising.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Hunting For Dracula in Transylvania</Title>
    <TitleURL>romania/travel/hunting-for-dracula-in-transylvania</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-04-02T11:49:53.523+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;No trip to Romania would be complete without a visit to the mysterious lands of Transylvania. Since Bram Stoker famously used the location as a setting for the home of Draculas notorious castle it has become a region shrouded in legends and superstitions. However, we did not fear, as armed with bucket loads of garlic and a wooden stake we set off to see what we would find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/romania-27.jpg" alt="peles castle romania"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With very limited time we decided to take a day tour from Bucharest which would take us to visit two of Transylvania&amp;rsquo;s castles. The group was small, consisting of two Italians, two Indians, a Dutchman and us. The question was.. would we all be coming back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/group-dracula-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We drove for several hours whilst our lively tour guide Serban Riga (Travel Maker Tours) kept us entertained with his extensive knowledge of Romania. The first stop on the Two Castles in One Day tour was to be Peles Castle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peles Castle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far from haunting, this fairy tale castle was once the summer home of Romania&amp;rsquo;s royal family before being confiscated after the communist takeover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/romania-34.jpg" alt="peles castle in the tress"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bavarian style castle is nestled within the Carpathians Mountains surrounded by pine trees and snow-capped peaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/romania-30.jpg" alt="peles castle"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is the outside picturesque, the inside is equally stunning. The walls and ceilings of the grand entranceway are covered with ornately carved wood. There is also an impressive weapons room, an Arabic styled room and a library, complete with its very own secret staircases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/images/uploads/medium/romania-24.jpg" alt="peles castle and statue"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After leaving this beautiful building behind we made our way to the heartland of Dracula. Driving through the Transylvanian valley we caught our first sight of Romanian gypsies. Our guide drew our attention to the cars parked outside their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/romania-41.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The houses look really poor, yet there are always really expensive BMWs and Audis outside&amp;rdquo;. Serban was not wrong, as we passed a &amp;pound;80,000 Audi and various BMWs. If your car has ever went missing and never found again this would be a good place to start looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Brans Castle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We took time to have some lunch overlooking Brans castle wondering if Dracula would be waiting. The extremely strong garlic sauce that accompanied my pork knuckle dinner would be enough to scare any vampire back into hiding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brans castle, the so called Draculas castle, sits prominently on a hill. This Medieval fortress was designed to be imposing as it was used to control the passage into the Transylvanian valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/romania-52.jpg" alt="bran castle "   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We entered the castle via steep stone stairs but we had already made a glaring mistake in the hunt for Dracula, coming during the day. As most people know, Dracula only shows himself after sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/images/uploads/medium/romania-42.jpg" alt="bran castle stairs"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The castle was once left for ruin, but was bought and renovated by the Romanian royal family, many of the walls are white washed and are now children&amp;rsquo;s nursery&amp;rsquo;s, bedrooms, and games rooms. The courtyard still retains some of the original history of the castle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/images/uploads/medium/romania-45.jpg" alt="bran castle courtyard"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the legends&amp;nbsp;are true, and he does still wander&amp;nbsp;these halls at night, there is every chance he may soon be evicted, as the current owners have it up for sale for an eye watering 60 million euro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/romania-44.jpg" alt="bran castle roof"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For us, we never did find Dracula, or any trace that such a man existed. So we ditched the garlic and wooden stakes and headed back to our tour bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/romania-51.jpg" alt="bran castle"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last stop on the tour was the city of Brasov. You can&amp;rsquo;t forget the name, the Hollywood style sign sits high above the surrounding hills as a permanent reminder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/romania-60.jpg" alt="brasov square and sign"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The once fortified town is full of timeworn buildings and is famed for its &amp;ldquo;black church&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/romania-61.jpg" alt="brasov square and church"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it is a charming place to spend a few hours we were unable to stay for long. We had successfully crammed in as much of Transylvania&amp;rsquo;s sights as we possibly could before we had to make the three hour drive back to Bucharest.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;No trip to Romania would be complete without a visit to the mysterious lands of Transylvania. Since Bram Stoker famously used the location as a setting for the home of Draculas notorious castle it has become a region shrouded in legends and superstitions. However, we did not fear, as armed with bucket loads of garlic and a wooden stake we set off to see what we would find.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Romanian Plum Brandy</Title>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Ranging from clear to mauve to deep purple, this Romanian fire water can&amp;rsquo;t be missed. This plum based brandy is sold in bars, restaurants and even in the street as home brewed specials are served straight up from an old plastic water bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/romania-12.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Known locally as Tuica this highly flammable drink can contain anywhere between 30-60% alcohol. Traditionally the plums are fermented for 6-8 weeks before being distilled in a brass sill using a wood burning fire. After distillation it can be aged for 6 months to 10 years or drank straight away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/romania-10.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While visiting an old-style beer house in Bucharest we decided to try the lighter less aged variety. Served ice cold in a delicate glass this innocent looking drink blew our heads off. I can only imagine it is what it would taste like to drink paint stripper as my throat and oesophagus burnt like hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/romania-11.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karl bravely tried an offering of a darker coloured brandy served as a taster from a woman on a market in Transylvania. Needless to say, he politely declined the offer to buy the full bottle&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Fort Cochin - The Return to India</Title>
    <TitleURL>india/travel/fort-cochin-the-return-to-india</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-04-07T05:36:51.047+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;I can hardly believe it has been 10 years since we last visited India. When I was 18 this was the first country I backpacked around and it ignited my passion for travelling. I have so many amazing memories from the 5 months I spent in this eclectic country that when we found flights taking us through Kerala to get to Australia we both decided it would be worth spending a couple of weeks there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/fort-cochin-16.jpg" alt="indian women drawing graffiti"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last time I visited Kerala it was in the monsoon season so I remember a lot of rain. This time we arrived well into the summer. Getting off the plane close to midnight we were greeted with a wave of 30 degree heat. I had often reminisced about all the amazing things in India, but getting off the plane hot and worn-out from travelling and then having to deal with the crowds of people and lack of queuing systems made all the stressful memories come flooding back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/fort-cochin-20.jpg" alt="incense shop india"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After managing to get a taxi we began our drive to Fort Kochi where we would be spending our first 2 nights. Despite the roads being rather empty we were still faced with danger as a guy had fell asleep in his taxi at the traffic lights, causing all kind of chaos. Thankfully, our driver was kind enough to pull over next to him, whack the car with his hand and wake him up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning we set off to explore Kochi town and went for a walk along the beach to see the Chinese fishing nets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/fort-cochin-10.jpg" alt="Chinese fishing net"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The surrounding area was more tourist orientated than I remember. With shops and restaurants filling most of the streets we couldn&amp;rsquo;t help enjoying a bit of shopping along the way. After finding that a majority of the scarfs in South America were made in China I was on the lookout for a genuine &amp;lsquo;made in India&amp;rsquo; scarf. I had to explain to Karl, as he began to moan, that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t just any scarf I was looking for, it was a Pashmina scarf. Well worth spending the time bargaining for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were dying to try some Keralan dishes so went to a recommended fusion restaurant for lunch to try the fish curries. The mix of spices and coconut flavours are divine. In my opinion there really is no better food in the world than Indian food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/fort-cochin-12.jpg" alt="keralan fish curry"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To see the other side of Kochi we took a rickshaw for 50p to see the numerous, temples, churches and mosques which line the streets, stopping off at the old Dutch Palace and spice market along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/fort-cochin-25.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the evening we went to see a traditional Kathakali show. The performers and musicians spend 6 years learning the discipline which focuses on precise movements and facial expressions. Shows can last up to 9 hours although we chose to attend a shorter introduction and performance designed for tourists. The costumes are spectacular and it is a wonderful and distinctive part of Kerala&amp;rsquo;s culture. However, after an hour and a half of very loud chimes being rang in our ears we were glad we weren&amp;rsquo;t sitting through a full show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/fort-cochin-31.jpg" alt="Kathakali show"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being back in India, and absorbing its many unique sights, sounds and smells has opened up our senses and we are looking forward to enjoying our time back in this vibrant country.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Relaxing in a Luxurious Houseboat on Kerala's Gorgeous Backwaters</Title>
    <TitleURL>india/travel/relaxing-in-a-luxurious-houseboat-on-kerala's-gorgeous-backwaters</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-04-07T05:58:28.683+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Cruising Kerala&amp;rsquo;s backwaters in a luxurious overnight house boat was perhaps the most relaxing thing we have ever done, but the day didn&amp;rsquo;t start that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/alleppey-house-boat-53.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We took a taxi from our homestay in Fort Cochin, following the road along the coast, we wound our way through the lush palm fringed landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/alleppey-house-boat-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fair to say India&amp;rsquo;s roads are nothing short of chaos, not only are there cars, motorbikes, trucks and rickshaws but the road is shared with cyclists, families walking, people doing business and random souls just hanging out. And there are a lot of people In India! Add to this an assortment of free roaming cows, goats and dogs it is easy to see why there&amp;rsquo;s always something coming at you head on. We expected our driver to be used to all this so weren&amp;rsquo;t too worried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was until we looked out the window and all we could see was a parked rickshaw getting closer and closer. As we braced for impact the driver quickly swerved to the left and there was a loud crash. In the end it was just the wing mirror that got hurt. The driver stopped the car to retrieve the now glass-less mirror, it was at this point that I looked for the other wing mirror and noticed that it was nowhere to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only in India is it possible to hit something parked on the opposite side of the road and still hold down a job as a taxi driver!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/alleppey-house-boat-1.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The statues of Ganesh, which lined the dashboard, must have been working their magic as we managed to arrive at the dock in one piece. We wondered how habitable the boat would be as we had booked in advance through the owner of the homestay in Kochin. Stepping onto the boat was disappointing, easily described as old, dirty and un-appealing. Luckily we moved straight through and onto another house boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was quite obvious that this boat was worth the 8000 rupees (&amp;pound;80) we paid for the night. The boat was clean, well-furnished and even had air conditioning in the bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/alleppey-house-boat-9.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The air conditioned dining room came with a with complementary fruit bowl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/alleppey-house-boat-7.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the relaxing lounge area had comfortable seats to take in the view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/alleppey-house-boat-40.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the back of the boat was the kitchen where our private chef would be making our meals. As we left the dock the chef brought us coconuts with a straw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/alleppey-house-boat-6.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a moment it felt like we were kings! All that was left to do now was put our feet up, relax and watch the world go by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/alleppey-house-boat-16.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kerelan backwaters are beautiful, some might say heavenly. The waters are lined with palm trees, rice paddies and Indians going about their daily business. Just watching the world go by from the privacy of our boat made it all the better as we could not be disturbed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/alleppey-house-boat-41.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were people fishing with handmade bamboo rods while, further down the river, a few brave boys picked coconuts. We passed women washing the clothes and men working the rice fields. A real glimpse into what life is like in this unique corner of India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/alleppey-house-boat-50.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As lunch was being prepared we retired to the dining room. The driver put on his best serving jacket and helped the cook serve what can only be described as a curry feast. There was enough curry to feed a family. The mix of flavours were just amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/alleppey-house-boat-31.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later in the day after much relaxing, the cook asked us if we would like to stop at a local fisherman&amp;rsquo;s hut to buy something to cook for tea. The boat moored outside a small shack at the edge of the backwaters. The three fisherman inside were keen to sell us some of their catch. Crabs, prawns and several varieties of fish were laid out neatly. I thought it was about time Leanne got over her dislike of prawns. The fisherman noticed my keen interest and handed me the biggest prawn they had, grabbing it by its antennae and swinging it in my direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was too hard to refuse, I ended up buying the two biggest prawns I had ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/alleppey-house-boat-44.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We continued to relax into a hazy day dream as we floated along the backwaters. As the sun began to set we moored into a small village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/alleppey-house-boat-59.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The village was a ram shackle selection of basic housing around an inlet on the water ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/alleppey-house-boat-61.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we went for an afternoon stroll along the narrow paths the villagers welcomed us warmly and the children asked us questions inquisitively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/alleppey-house-boat-68.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tea was much like lunch, amazingly tasty, but there was far too much to eat. As the night closed in we drank a few beers and headed to bed relaxed and stuffed full of curry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/alleppey-house-boat-72.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fitting ending to a perfect day on the Keralan backwaters.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Sun, Sea, Sand and Weird Massages  - Varkala and Kovalam</Title>
    <TitleURL>india/travel/sun-sea-sand-and-weird-massages-varkala-and-kovalam</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-04-15T13:55:25.283+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Southern Kerala&amp;rsquo;s two main beach resorts are Varkala and Kovalam. As we were looking forward to a few days of sun, sea and sand we decided to incorporate both into our trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kerala-beaches-1.jpg" alt="varkala coast"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We firstly headed to Varkala which was said to be more backpacker orientated, however when we arrived we found it to be a lot more developed than we thought it would be, with many shops, bars and restaurants lining the cliff overlooking the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kerala-beaches-2.jpg" alt="varkala beach"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing we couldn&amp;rsquo;t fail to miss was the number of hotels and spas offering Ayurveda treatments. Neither of us had heard of this before, so after gathering a few leaflets and doing a bit of research online we found out that it was a well-established holistic therapy which originated in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kerala-beaches-13.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the treatments focus on the use of oil, poured over and into the body, one even involves injecting fluid into the anus or vagina! Other strange procedures include bloodletting and purging. The variety of treatments on offer claim to be able to cure almost all ailments, although we were sceptical, we were willing to try one of the less extreme options called Sirodhara. This involves having medicated oil poured onto the forehead, although we doubted it would cure neurological disorders and insomnia, as it claimed, it did look relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We negotiated a deal were we both got a full body oil massage followed by the Sirodhara treatment. As we went off into our separate treatment rooms I was followed in by a lady who passed me a small paper thong and told me to get changed. This left little to the imagination but as I lay face down on the bed, listening to the soft music I began to relax. After several minutes of bum rubbing followed by some breast fondling I did start to question if what this woman was doing to me was actually legal. I had to supress a laugh thinking about Karl in the next room with the creepy, moustached Indian man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kerala-beaches-6.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once suitably lubricated the lady then moved onto heating some oil on a gas burner for the Sirodhara. As I smelt burning I became only too aware of how flammable I was. Thankfully the oil wasn&amp;rsquo;t heated too much as it was took off the burner and placed into a metal jar over my head which allowed a small amount to continuously flow out. This actually felt quite nice for the first few minutes but after a while I felt overwhelmingly hot and was keen for it to end so I could have a shower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left glowing, with the oil that just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t wash off, and waited for Karl to finish his treatment. When he emerged I could see from his face that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t impressed. In fact, his comments went something like this..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lying naked with your bare bum exposed, covered in oil, while a man with a moustache rubs you up and down paying far too much attention to your arse cheeks, is not my kind of fun. What makes it worse is I was supressing the urge to fart last night&amp;rsquo;s curry on his worn and sandpaper like hands. He then proceeded to pour warm oil onto my forehead for half an hour while I lay there with a see-though piece of toilet paper covering my dignity, all the while wondering what kind of moron pays for this shit.. oh yeah.. me! Never again will I listen to Leanne.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it was a new experience, but one which left us feeling slightly violated. I doubt we will be trying Ayurveda again anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kerala-beaches-14.jpg" alt="kovalam lighthouse"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of our time on the beach was a lot more relaxing and after a few days we moved further south to Kovalam. There are a few larger hotels and resort close to the beach but it was still a relatively small and chilled out place with a picturesque lighthouse to accompany the sea view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kerala-beaches-23.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feeling revitalised we were now ready to move onto the livelier paced city of Travandrum.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Searching for Tigers – Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary</Title>
    <TitleURL>india/travel/searching-for-tigers-periyar-wildlife-sanctuary</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-04-15T14:06:02.08+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;After spending one night in the chaotic city of Trivandrum we couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait to escape the stifling heat and continuous sound of horns beeping. So off we set, into the mountains, to Kumily, the town closest to the Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/periyar-4.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The journey took a grueling 9 hours. We travelling on a local KSRTC bus which cost the equivalent of &amp;pound;2.50 each. But it was not a pleasant journey. Consisting of several hours of sweating and then regularly having to peel yourself from the plastic seats. This was the mode of transport I had frequently used when I last travelled around India, however, I am no longer 18, and I soon began reminiscing about the luxurious air conditioned busses in South America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/periyar-6.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We began our first day at the park with a jeep safari. I use the word &amp;lsquo;safari&amp;rsquo; in the loosest possible sense as it involved no animal spotting whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/periyar-11.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although our driver did spend 10 minutes pointing out an invisible deer, to the point where we had to agree we had seen&amp;nbsp;it so that he would continue driving. Despite the significant lack of wildlife it was a nice way to see the area and we caught a beautiful sunrise over the forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/periyar-7.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the afternoon we headed into the park to take the popular Periyar Lake boat tour, hoping that we would have better luck spotting wildlife by the water. In the short time we were on the boat we did manage to spot some deer, bison, otters, countless birds and a huge snake. We were glad to be in the confounds of the boat as the snake moved worryingly fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/periyar-31.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 777 square kilometer park is home to numerous wild elephants and over 30 tigers. Unfortunately we were unable to catch sight of these on our visit. However, one animal which wasn&amp;rsquo;t shy was the monkeys, which crowded round the park entrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/periyar-27.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karl was welcomed into their group as one of their own and was able to get some close up, personal shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/periyar-28.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The baby monkeys were so cute!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/periyar-29.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, on the other hand, was shunned from the group, as one mischievous monkey chased me away. I never did like the Indian monkeys!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/periyar-23.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We retreated back to our hotel where we were able to relax and watch the sun go down over park from our balcony. We even saw some bison come to graze in the nearby grass lands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/periyar-33.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the lack of elephants and tigers we can see why this is a popular holiday destination for Indian families, as the cool air and lush green scenery seem a world away from the hassle and noise of India&amp;rsquo;s hectic cities.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Spotting Wild Elephants in the Rolling Hills of Munnars Tea Plantations</Title>
    <TitleURL>india/travel/spotting-wild-elephants-in-the-rolling-hills-of-munnars-tea-plantations</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-04-16T11:27:11.48+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;The great thing about India is that it&amp;rsquo;s so cheap. No longer are we backpackers, we have fully morphed into flashpackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/munnar-9.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We took a leisurely four and half hour taxi ride from Kumily and when we arrived in the rolling hills of Munnar we hired a personal guide/driver/generally helpful person to make our stay as easy as possible. Before heading to our hotel, located high up in the hills, our driver took us to get some supplies from the bustling town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/munnar-17.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were then dropped off in the serenity of our hotel, with its balcony overlooking the valley below. The view was only briefly spoiled by the short evening downpours of rain that fell, making this one of the greenest regions in Kerala. As our driver left us we made a plan for him to return at 7.00am in the morning to go on a tour of this idyllic region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/munnar-16.jpg" alt="munnar farm estate"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first stop was Mattupetty dam, though it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty ugly concrete structure it was a good place to watch the sun rise over the lake it conserves. As we arrived early we were pretty much alone, which is a rarity in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/munnar-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our driver continued the journey though the winding roads of the tea plantations and mountains to a high pass with wonderful views over the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/munnar-4.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also tried some tea from a local tea stand. Surprisingly, considering that we were in the middle of tea plantations, the tea was awful. In traditional Indian style the tea is mainly sugar and milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/munnar-18.jpg" alt="tea leaf"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The driver turned into our guide and gave us some details about the tea plantations. The workers are paid 350 rupees a day (&amp;pound;3.50) for 8 hours work. No wonder our driver is happy with the 1600 (&amp;pound;16) we paid him for his services. Though the tea pickers get housing, food and free health care included, so it&amp;rsquo;s not such a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/munnar-14.jpg" alt="munnar tea pickers"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We agreed to meet the driver at the road on the other side of the valley so that we could take a walk through the tea estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/munnar-7.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next stop was the Top Station at 1700m where we walked down to absorb the splendid views of the surrounding hills. The walk back up was horrific in the heat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/munnar-11.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the Indian tourists found me more of an attraction than the view, and I spared some time for a selfie with these two guys! It&amp;rsquo;s surprising how many people want to speak to you because you are a westerner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/munnar-12.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The uphill struggle had made us hungry so we went for Indian breakfast. Idli Rice cake, spicy curried onions and a boiled egg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/munnar-13.jpg" alt="indian breakfast "   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We visited another dam, there were many stalls set up around both sides of the concrete monolith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/munnar-21.jpg" alt="indian coconut stall"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But being near water in India is not always fun as most of it is polluted. Though it never stops the locals washing their clothes in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/munnar-19.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we were driving away the driver now became an elephant spotter. He stopped the car and pointed up into a hill of tea leaves. On the edge of the plantation were several wild elephants. After all the failed time looking for wild elephants in Periyar this made up for it. Though the elephants were too far away for a good photo. In hindsight, this was probably a good thing as we later learnt that they kill 300 people a year in India. Still, it was amazing see these fantastic creatures in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/munnar-23.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next stop was the rose garden, though I didn&amp;rsquo;t see any roses. I suppose I didn&amp;rsquo;t care to look. Though I did find the many Indians with their colourful Saris as interesting as they found me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/munnar-25.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get up close and personal with&amp;nbsp;an elephant the driver took us for an elephant ride. At the time we&amp;nbsp;could not decide as to whether it is was actually cruel or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/munnar-26.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The elephants were captured from the wild and tamed. Surely they would have been better off roaming freely with their family. Now it was taking us and many other tourists on a small walk through some trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/munnar-28.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end the elephant seemed happy enough when we fed her some pineapples and corn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/munnar-30.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By now we were hungry again so the driver took us to a local restaurant. For only 90p we got the English equivalent of an all you can eat. The thali was served on a banana leaf, the delicious mixture of curries, rice, sides and poppadums&amp;rsquo; are continually served until you are full. There were no knives and forks. Like most Indian food you should eat it with your right hand as the left hand is reserved for other dirtier business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/munnar-31.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final stop was the tea museum where we watched a video on the tea plantations and attended a talk. The talk was meant to be about the process of making tea, but turned out to be an old Indian man rambling on about the digestive properties and benefits of tea, though all I can remember was him talking about his grandad squeezing one out for 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/munnar-33.jpg" alt="munnar tea museum"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feeling tired we got dropped back off at the hotel, for a small additional fee our driver, and new best friend, was picking us up in the morning to put is on the bus back to kochin.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;The great thing about India is that it&amp;rsquo;s so cheap. No longer are we backpackers, we have fully morphed into flashpackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/munnar-9.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We took a leisurely four and half hour taxi ride from Kumily and when we arrived in the rolling hills of Munnar we hired a personal guide/driver/generally helpful person to...</ContentPreview>

    <Title>How to Cook Traditional South Indian Food</Title>
    <TitleURL>india/travel/how-to-cook-traditional-south-indian-food</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-04-19T04:51:20.997+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Our favourite food in the world is Indian and we could not wait to&amp;nbsp;learn the secrets of South Indian home cooking. So when Gigi let us visit her kitchen to make several Kerelan favourites we jumped at the chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kerelan-cooking-28.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered what to do with a Coconut? Or how to make cabbage more interesting? Well these recipes which we learnt during our South Indian cooking lesson&amp;nbsp;will certainly give you some inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Coconut&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cocount is used in nearly all the following recipies so before we started to cook we prepared our coconut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First the coconut was copped in half, the flesh removed and thinly sliced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kerelan-cooking-2.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grated Coconut&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the grated coconut the flesh was put in a blender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kerelan-cooking-4.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coconut Milk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6 table spoons of grated coconut was reserved for later, the remaining was added to a&amp;nbsp;sieve. We added enough water to wet the coconut and squeezed it by hand, releasing the milk into the cup below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kerelan-cooking-6.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process was repeated once more until we had a cup of fresh coconut milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Banana and Coconut Curry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dish is fresh and sweet, you can replace the bannana for other sweet fruits such as pineapple. Its very quick and easy but tastes amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kerelan-cooking-45.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Banana &amp;ndash; 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Coconut Milk &amp;ndash; &amp;frac12; cup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Cumin Seed &amp;ndash; &amp;frac14; tea spoon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Mustard Seed &amp;ndash; &amp;frac14; tea spoon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Turmeric powder &amp;ndash; &amp;frac12; tea spoon&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Dry red chili &amp;ndash; 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Curry Leaves &amp;ndash; a pinch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Curd or Natural Yoghurt &amp;ndash; 1 cup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Coconut oil &amp;ndash; 1 large spoon&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Salt &amp;ndash; to taste&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.Chop the Banana into small pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.Heat the coconut oil in a pan and add cumin seeds and mustard seeds until popping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kerelan-cooking-22.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;3.Add curry leaves and dried chilli to the pan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kerelan-cooking-23.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Add chopped banana or pineapple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kerelan-cooking-24.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.Add the coconut milk and continue stiring to soften the fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kerelan-cooking-25.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Add the curd (or fresh yogurt), salt and turmeric, and then lightly simmer for 2-3 minutes. (If you use pineapple instead cook&amp;nbsp;for longer, approx. 10 min)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kerelan-cooking-26.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Green Mango and Fish Curry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tradtional dish is a delight, the bitter mango goes well with the coconut. The fish and mango could easily be replaced to make your own version of this tropical&amp;nbsp;curry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kerelan-cooking-42.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Fish &amp;ndash; 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Coconut milk &amp;ndash; 1 cup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Curry leaves &amp;ndash; I pinch&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Green Mango &amp;ndash; 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Salt &amp;ndash; to taste&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.Slice the onion, chilli and garlic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.Peal the mango and cut into chunks&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kerelan-cooking-9.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keralan Cabbage Thoran&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of my favourite South Indian dishes and quite possible the best cabbage dish in the world. It tastes just as nice with sliced coconut rather than grated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kerelan-cooking-43.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Vegetable (cabbage or cauliflower) &amp;ndash; 250g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Ginger &amp;ndash; 1 small piece&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Garlic &amp;ndash; 1 small piece&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Green Chilli &amp;ndash; 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Curry leaves &amp;ndash; a pinch&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Grated Coconut &amp;ndash; 3 tea spoons&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Coconut oil &amp;ndash; 1 big spoon&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Mustard seed &amp;ndash; a pinch&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Cumin seed &amp;ndash; a pinch&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Onion &amp;ndash; 1 smalll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Turmeric powder &amp;ndash; &amp;frac14; tea spoon&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Salt &amp;ndash; to taste&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Water &amp;ndash; &amp;frac12; cup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.Finely slice the cabbage (or cauliflower), onion, garlic and ginger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kerelan-cooking-18.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Coconut Rice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best rice dishes in the world is coconut rice. Heres how its done in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kerelan-cooking-44.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dhal Fry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chappatis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingrediants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Wholemeal flour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.42857;"&gt;Water&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Mix the flour, water and salt into a ball. Split into indvidual&amp;nbsp;pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kerelan-cooking-36.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Feast&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we had finished the cooking we were expected to eat this amazing feast between us both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kerelan-cooking-41.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could not eat it all but we gave it our best shot, the food was amazing and we will be trying these recipes at home, thats if we ever find a place to call home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;Our favourite food in the world is Indian and we could not wait to&amp;nbsp;learn the secrets of South Indian home cooking. So when Gigi let us visit her kitchen to make several Kerelan favourites we jumped at the chance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>The Beating Heart of Asia - Kuala Lumpur</Title>
    <TitleURL>malaysia/travel/the-beating-heart-of-asia-kuala-lumpur</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-04-28T04:37:58.303+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Kuala Lumpur is not a city built for pedestrians. The vast assortment of public transport options are a tourists best bet when planning on sightseeing. However, deciphering the system may push your relationship to limit, particularly if you are travelling as a couple. After spending over an hour trying to find the few sights, which claimed to be 5 minutes away from our hotel, we decided it was not worth the effort of walking. The rail/tram/monorail/bus system may be confusing at first glance but once mastered it&amp;rsquo;s a clean, cheap and cool way to get around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kualalumper-5.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is certainly plenty to see. We started by visiting Merdeka Square which was once the centre of British colonial rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kualalumper-3.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also visited the Kuala Lumpur gallery where a 3d model allows you to see this impressive city from a different perspective. There has been an astonishing amount of construction work to build this modern city and it hasn&amp;rsquo;t stopped yet, with many more new developments planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the evening we headed to the atmospheric China Town and sampled some local foods, including chicken satay and an unusual street eat which involved piling your plate with sticks of meat and veg and then either have a guy grill them for you, or cook them yourself in a pot of boiling water at your table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kualalumper-42.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day we headed to the commercial centre, known as the Golden Triangle, where the iconic Petronas Towers are located. Instead of spending the day in a museum or shopping centre we decided to visit the Aquarium. We are not usually inclined to visit these potential tourist traps but found it to be a fun way to spend a few hours. It has a 90m underwater tunnel, and you can&amp;rsquo;t fail to be impressed as the sharks swim past your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kualalumper-11.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get a good view of the towers we decided to head up to the nearby Skybar. The view was excellent but the service was shocking, so after sitting there for 20 minutes we decided not to waste &amp;pound;20 on two beers, and left, happy enough that we had got the photograph without having to pay the ridiculous prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kualalumper-17.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another popular area for street food is Jalan Alor. We were famished after a day of sightseeing and ordered plenty to feast on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kualalumper-24.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The street is full of people, performers and music, and the air is filled with amazing smells which drift from the bubbling pots and flaming grills. It&amp;rsquo;s the perfect place for people watching with a cool beer and a plate of noodles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we took the train to the Batu Caves, the cave complex is guarded by a giant statue of the Hindu deity Murugan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kualalumper-26.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The steps to the top were not difficult but the attacking monkeys made for an interesting climb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/kualalumper-34.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We left Kuala Lumpur feeling awestruck; this city really does feel like the beating heart of South East Asia.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;Kuala Lumpur is not a city built for pedestrians. The vast assortment of public transport options are a tourists best bet when planning on sightseeing. However, deciphering the system may push your relationship to limit, particularly if you are travelling as a couple. After spending over an hour trying to find the few sights, which claimed to be 5 minutes away from our hotel, we decided it was...</ContentPreview>

    <Title>Visiting the Tropical Island of Langkawi on a Backpackers Budget</Title>
    <TitleURL>malaysia/travel/visiting-the-tropical-island-of-langkawi-on-a-backpackers-budget</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-04-28T06:46:03.137+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tropical island of Langkawi and the surrounding archipelago, with its white sand beaches, sparkling waters and lush jungle, is Malaysia&amp;rsquo;s resort island for the middling rich to wealthy. Its Malaysia&amp;rsquo;s answer to Thailand&amp;rsquo;s famous resort islands of Phuket and Ko Samui although much less developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/langkawi-12.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wherever there are holiday resorts and two week holiday makers&amp;rsquo;, prices tend to sky rocket. So why are two backpackers even there? Luckily there are&amp;nbsp;a few budget options left to accommodate those who don&amp;rsquo;t want to fork out a small fortune. Here&amp;rsquo;s how we did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Where to Stay on Langkawi&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few cheap accommodations on Langkawi for those on a backpackers budget. We ended up staying in Pantai Tengah. Pantai Tengah is home to several all-inclusive resorts, there is a small beach and it&amp;rsquo;s a 20-30 minute walk to the long golden stretch of beach at Pantai Cenang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/langkawi-9.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We chose to stay at Zackery Guest House which ended up being one of the best budget options we have stayed in on our travels so far. It&amp;rsquo;s no five star resort, but for &amp;pound;15 a night you really get your money&amp;rsquo;s worth. Our double room had air conditioning, daily cleaning and an en-suite, along with plenty of cold beers on sale for a very affordable 40p (2RM) a can, we really couldn&amp;rsquo;t complain. The lady who owns the guesthouse will go out of her way to help you enjoy your stay and there are many day trips on offer which she has negotiated considerably cheaper than what you pay at the resorts or travel agents. Overall, Zackary Guest house is a cheap, clean, friendly option and we can&amp;rsquo;t recommend this place highly enough if you are looking for a budget pace to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting around the island can raise your expenses, particularly if you are a little out of the way. That problem was easily solved by renting a scooter for &amp;pound;4 (20RM) a day, as petrol&amp;rsquo;s only 20p per litre you can fill the tank for &amp;pound;1 and be on you way. Our guesthouse owner had plenty available scooters on hand for us to hire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/langkawi-4.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If riding on two wheels is not for you, small cars can be hired for &amp;pound;10 (50RM) per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What to Drink&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Langkawi is a duty free island thus making it one of the cheapest places to buy drinks in the heavily taxed Malaysia. Spirits wines and beers can be bought hugely discounted from the Duty Free Shops around the island. One litre of Captain Morgan&amp;rsquo;s spiced rum cost us &amp;pound;7 (35RM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/langkawi-50.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drinking in the many bars is more expensive but there are several popup beach bars near Pantai Tengah that serve cheap drinks, though they are probably illegal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What to Eat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For local Malay food you can visit Siti Fatimah. For only &amp;pound;1.40 (7RM) you can help yourself to all-you-can-eat local dishes. The array of strong flavours, curries, fish and chicken dishes served with rice and noodles will certainly excite and fill you simultaneously. A drink is included making this one of the cheapest eats on the island. To get there you will need transportation, we went on our scooter but taking a taxi would be another option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cheapest places for food on the whole island are the night markets where hundreds of stalls serve local Malay street food. Just wandering around the stalls, the smells of grilled meats and fish barbequing, noodles frying and curries bubbling away in a mist of steam and smoke is a must see experience in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/langkawi-14.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The night markets are held at various locations around the island so you will need to find out in advance where to go. You will most likely need transport to get there. Our scooter came in handy once again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/langkawi-18.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the food is wrapped to take way so we filled a bag full of food. You can get Nasi Goreng (fried noodles) for 20p (2RM,) and grilled chicken for &amp;pound;1 (5RM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/langkawi-19.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What we thought were 10p sausages on a stick turned out to be chicken necks, though very tasty, there is only is small bit of skin and fat wrapping the bony neck. I think the dog enjoyed them more than me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/langkawi-20.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What to Do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for only &amp;pound;25 a day we are set up with everything we need, accommodation, food, transport and even drinks. That&amp;rsquo;s only &amp;pound;12.50 per person per day. The only thing left to do is explore this beautiful island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Catch Some Sun on the Beach&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that anyone wants to check out on a paradise island is the beaches and that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Tengah Beach&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This beach was very close to our guesthouse and the first place we visited on the island. It&amp;rsquo;s relaxed and secluded and for us it was the perfect introduction to the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/langkawi-1.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Cenang Beach&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cenang beach is the longest and most developed on the island and for good reason. The sand is white and fine and the water a gorgeous turquoise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/langkawi-11.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are water sports, island hopping tours and beach shacks along the sands, behind on the road there are restaurants, bars and shops. It&amp;rsquo;s easily the liveliest place on the island yet somehow it still retains a quite peaceful allure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/langkawi-13.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Tanjung Rhu Beach&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanjung Rhu is located in the far north of the island, the location is well out of the way meaning it is an almost private retreat for guests of the nearby luxury resorts. Being so far away we never made it. We drove for an hour and were only just past half way there. The incessant clouds covering the north side of the island dampened our spirits so we turned round and went straight back to sunny Cenang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sky Bridge and Cable Car&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sky bridge is major attraction on the island. Walking through the Oriental village and waiting in the queue for cable cars you could quite easily mistake if for a theme park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/langkawi-6.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cable car is reportedly the steepest in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/langkawi-5.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to say the views were out-of-this-world but the weather was not in our favour. Despite the clouds it was still an enjoyable day out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water Fall Hunting&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several waterfalls on Langkawi and you could spend a few days simply finding them all and swimming in the lush sparkling pools. We drove the scooter to Seven Wells Waterfall. After showing some alpha male aggression to some defensive monkeys we were allowed to enter the path leading to the cool, refreshing waterfall. Sweating in the heat we were disappointed to find pools full of stagnant water and a mere trickle dribbling down a rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/langkawi-10.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather stupidly, we had failed to anticipate that visiting waterfalls at the end of the dry season would be a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Island Hoping Tour&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joining a group island hopping tour is the cheapest way to see the surrounding islands. It is the number one thing to do while on Langkawi however we choose to see them a different way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/langkawi-28.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Jet Ski Tour of the Islands&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costing &amp;pound;100 (500Rm) for two people it&amp;rsquo;s considerably more than the island boat tour but sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s worth paying a bit more for. Our advice would be to shop around as resorts and travel agents will charge a lot more than the price organised at our guest house. We found out that the couple that came with us payed &amp;pound;140 (800Rm).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/langkawi-36.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The freedom of speeding around the ocean between deserted tropical islands was simply amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/langkawi-26.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our first stop was a small bay, where being a silly tw*t I jumped straight off the jet ski into four foot of water. At the bottom lay a very sharp and hard coral reef. The instant pain in the soles of my feet left me grasping for the jet-ski to get out the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leanne obviously got a little worried as there were puncture wounds in my feet and a small puddle of bloody water was forming in the side of Jet Ski. Our guide ripped up an old t-shirt and I tied it round my feet to stop the blood and we continued the tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/langkawi-29.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We sped across the sea to the Pregnant Maiden Lake where one of the staff noticed my ridiculous feet wrapped in old t-shirts and offered me first aid. The blood had stopped but my feet were cut and painful leaving me hobbling around for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/langkawi-32.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We raced across the waves to Wet Rice Island, a little slice of paradise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/langkawi-40.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We snorkelled with fish and enjoyed the beach. Spending most of the time relaxing in the sand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/langkawi-43.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final island on the tour was a secret uninhabited beach where we were able to park up the jet skis..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/langkawi-47.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and walk along the deserted beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/langkawi-46.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pristine ocean and velvety sands were simply magical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Snorkelling Tour&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The snorkelling tour takes you to Payar Island Marine Park, the tour is relatively expensive and after recently going snorkelling at the Belize Barrier reef we felt we would only be disappointed, our guesthouse owner agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/langkawi-41.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Just Sit Back and Chill&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/langkawi-25.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There simply nothing better than just enjoying island life and relaxing. Langkawi was the perfect place to do so, making it one of the more difficult places for us to leave.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tropical island of Langkawi and the surrounding archipelago, with its white sand beaches, sparkling waters and lush jungle, is Malaysia&amp;rsquo;s resort island for the middling rich to wealthy.

    <Title>Sepilok – Orangutans and Sun Bears</Title>
    <TitleURL>malaysia/travel/sepilok-orangutans-and-sun-bears</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-05-18T23:48:33.057+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;We flew from the Malaysian island of&amp;nbsp;Langkawi to Sandakan in Eastern Borneo. The state of Sabah is well known as a base for modern day pirates and Borneo is famed for its head hunting tribes. Despite the dangers the main reason to come here is of course to experience nature, Borneo has one of the largest rain forest eco-systems in the world and is home to many species of animals that only exist on the island. Our first stop was to check out the animal rehabilitation centres nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sepilok Orang-utan Rehabilitation Centre&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orang-utans are synonymous with Borneo and we were excited to meet some at Sepilok rehabilitation centre. These lovable ginger apes are native to Indonesia and Malaysia and are only found in the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. It was shocking to discover that the depleting numbers of Orang-utans in Borneo has now put them on the endangered animal list. The situation is worse in Sumatra where there is estimated to be only 7,500 remaining, classifying them as &amp;ldquo;critically endangered&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/sepilok-12.jpg" alt="" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rehabilitation centre we visited aims to return orphaned, injured or displaced orang-utans back into the wild. To catch a glimpse of them we visited during the two daily feeding sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/sepilok-9.jpg" alt="" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orang-utans rely on their mothers to provide food for them up until the age of 5 or 6, so the orphaned orang-utans will come to the centre to feed until they are able to find their own sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/sepilok-17.jpg" alt="" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a nursery for the younger apes where they are rehabilitated before being released back into the wild. It was fascinating to watch these playful creatures appear from the trees swinging along the ropes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/sepilok-1.jpg" alt="" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 96.4% of our DNA is identical to orang-utans. Genetically speaking, along with chimpanzee and gorillas, it makes them our closest cousins. As one sat near the walkway we were able to get a close look at him and it&amp;rsquo;s not hard to see the resemblance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/sepilok-16.jpg" alt="" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she sat precariously perched on a tree, regurgitating her food onto a leaf and the eating it again it was hard not to be amazed. The likeness of this great ape to us is remarkable, the facial expressions reminded me of certain people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of a sudden she climbed out of the tree and started to climb onto the walk way. Heading straight for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/sepilok-20.jpg" alt="" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a second I did not know what to do, our heart rate began to increase as the adrenaline kicked in. A wild Orangutan was a meter away from and coming closer to within touching distance, we both wondered what she was planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/sepilok-21.jpg" alt="" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily she just wanted a walk along the fence. As we watched her walk away into the distance we were amazed, such an amazing moment coming face to face with one of our closest cousins will last a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/sepilok-22.jpg" alt="" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bornean Sun Bear conservation Centre&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We both knew very little about the world smallest bear when we entered the conservation centre but soon found out their situation was not much better than that of the Orang-utans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/sepilok-4.jpg" alt="" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sun bears survival is threatened by habitat loss and illegal hunting. Apparently there are hundreds of senseless people out there who actual want to keep them as pets. Cute when they are cubs, they soon grow up and are no longer wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we visited the centre it was full, currently holding 40 bears. We got a chance to speak to the guy who founded the project and so far he said they have only been able to successfully release one bear back into the wild, with the hope of releasing more later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/sepilok-6.jpg" alt="" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One distinctive feature of these bears is there unusually long tongue which is used for reaching honey. Sadly, it has been found that the population of sun bears, which are found throughout South East Asia, is in decline, by at least 30% over the past 30 years and is continuing to decline at this rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our visit to both centres ended up being an entertaining, informative, and in many ways, eye-opening, insight into these two unique animals.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;We flew from the Malaysian island of&amp;nbsp;Langkawi to Sandakan in Eastern Borneo. The state of Sabah is well known as a base for modern day pirates and Borneo is famed for its head hunting tribes. Despite the dangers the main reason to come here is of course to experience nature, Borneo has one of the largest rain forest eco-systems in the world and is home to many species of animals that only...</ContentPreview>

    <Title>Tribes and Headhunters of Kuching - The Beginning of The End</Title>
    <TitleURL>malaysia/travel/tribes-and-headhunters-of-kuching-the-beginning-of-the-end</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2016-05-18T23:57:59.397+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;We sat on the bus musing, the road cut through the thick rain forest of Borneo as we steadily climbed up and over the mountains of Kota Kinabalu national park. We knew this could well be the last bus we took. The trip that has took us through 26 countries was still in full swing but was rapidly drawing to an end, soon we would have to start looking for jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kota Kinablu is famous for having the highest mountain in South East Asia. Though after a close shave with a mountain in the Andes we decided to give the ascent to the top a miss, preferring the markets and local nightlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/kuching-23.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could have taken the bus through the country of Brunei and added one more country to the list, but tired and weary we instead hopped on a flight straight to Kuching bypassing one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most conservative nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Kuching&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kuching was to be our base for the next few days. The riverfront was the perfect place for a stroll. The cobbled walkway was lined with restaurants, food stalls and numerous street hawkers selling tree bark to improve your sex life. Chinese and old English colonial buildings made up the streets standing reluctantly proud as they have done for many years, the amazingly designed Legalistive building across the river brings a sign of the modern era. It&amp;rsquo;s the nicest area in Kuching and a place we spent many evenings wandering, eating and relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/kuching-2.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As this was the last week of the trip we decided to head out of town and check into a Four Star hotel, the Dami Beach Resort. The place had seen better days, its past hey day seemed long forgotten. Sections were closed, they kept a bunch of sad looking cats in a big bird cage (as we would learn later they only eat dogs so they were pretty safe). There was an American guy with what he claimed to be a dazzling rare bird siting, chained on his shoulder so it could not escape. Somehow we always attract the crazies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/kuching-7.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really there was no need for the bellboy to carry my backpack, something that over the past year I had perfected. The beach was nice and the hotel offered a half-baked luxury we were not accustomed too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/kuching-11.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we really came for was to visit the Malaysian Heritage Village where there were native long houses from the various tribes that inhabit Borneo. In each house there was people cooking local foods or demonstrating local cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/kuching-25.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying our luck at&amp;nbsp;blow pipe shooting was the highlight and we both hit the target on our second try. It was a surprisingly powerful piece of equipment. The half-naked tribesman didn&amp;rsquo;t put us off though they too were trying to sell us the mysterious tree bark (which we now know you are supposed to rub on your private parts to make them numb!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/kuching-19.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day ended as we watched the sun set behind the ocean, perhaps the last sunset of this trip. As it dropped off the end of the earth we headed back to Kuching, this time staying in one of the old colonial houses where we arranged a morning trip out of town to the Annah Rais long house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/kuching-12.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly what we were expecting. We wandered a through a ramshackle longhouse while the inhabitants dressed in Manchester United shirts watched TV and chatted on their mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/kuching-35.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We entered the head house where once the ancestors of the villages took the heads of their war victims to be smoked. In the centre there were several skulls, charred by the burning staring blankly towards us. Luckily for us the skulls were close to 100 years old and the tribe stopped headhunting a long time ago. (at least that&amp;rsquo;s what they told us)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/kuching-32.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mediocre trip was immediately improved when we paid a small fee to enter a native house claiming to be a museum set up by one of the enterprising locals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cheeful owner pulled out a huge bottle of homemade honey rum, passed some glasses around and started filling them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/kuching-41.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things started to get better as he talked us through the items in the museum whilst refilling our empty glasses and telling us to drink faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/kuching-43.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the items in the museum perhaps the most impressive was the header hunters backpack inherited though his family. It was strange to know that once upon a time it was used to carry the heads of enemy warriors&amp;nbsp;back to the village .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/kuching-46.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we headed back to Kuching a little light headed but with both our heads still attached. We knew the curtain was closing on this trip and the next day we would fly to Singapore, three days later we would be in Sydney the final destination of this trip. One adventure may have been closing but the doors were opening to a new world down under.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;We sat on the bus musing, the road cut through the thick rain forest of Borneo as we steadily climbed up and over the mountains of Kota Kinabalu national park. We knew this could well be the last bus we took. The trip that has took us through 26 countries was still in full swing but was rapidly drawing to an end, soon we would have to start looking for jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Checking out Penangs street art in Georgetown</Title>
    <TitleURL>malaysia/travel/checking-out-penangs-street-art-in-georgetown</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Georgetown, on Penang Island, is on all the recommended itineraries for Malaysia and as there are loads of cheap flights from Kuala Lumpur we decided to head there next. On the drive&amp;nbsp;from the airport to Georgetown we soon realised this wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to be a tropical Island experience, as all around us was tarmacked roads and concreate shopping malls.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/penang-(1).jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Georgetown is a UNISCO world heritage site due to the amount of colonial architecture and historical buildings. Maybe we have been to one too many colonial towns but we were not blown away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/penang-(6).jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another advertising feature of the city is its unique street art painted by Ernest Zacharevic. You can follow a map which details where the paintings are located or, alternatively, you can hire a Trishaw to take you to a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/penang-(7).jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paintings are interesting and incorporate parts of the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/penang-(11).jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most well-known pieces is the &amp;ldquo;Little Children on a Bicycle&amp;rdquo; mural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/penang-(5).jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did end up feeling sorry for the guy having to push us around in 30 degree heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/penang-(4).jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The art was good, but we were less than impressed with the city, so we decided to see what the nightlife was like, and found a few cool bars near our hotel filled with a nice crowd of backpackers. This turned into a night filled with several buckets of beer, a bizarre ladyboy show and a stolen bottle of tabasco sauce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Penang does have many other attractions, including a national park and popular spice plantation but we decided to save the national park visits for Borneo, and after our night of drinking we didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like hiking around a spice plantation. We may well have missed out on some sites but we are sure the rest of the country will deliver.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>In the Footsteps of Wallace - Wildlife Spotting in Borneo's Rainforests</Title>
    <TitleURL>malaysia/travel/in-the-footsteps-of-wallace-wildlife-spotting-in-borneo's-rainforests</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;To experience nature, while in Borneo, we booked a trip to the Kinabatangan River where we would spend three days / two nights staying at the Myne Riverside Resort. Our purpose of being there was to see the wildlife and with three river cruises, one night safari and one jungle walk planned we were certainly hopeful of spotting at least a few animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/borneo-jungle-lodge-4.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were familiar with the Kinabatangan River before we visited after previously seeing it on a BBC documentary entitled &amp;lsquo;Bill Bailey&amp;rsquo;s Jungle Hero&amp;rsquo;. In the programme Bill follows the trail of Darwin&amp;rsquo;s rival Wallace, as he travels around Malaysia and Borneo. Wallace spent much time exploring the river and uncovering previously undiscovered species. A few, including the famous Wallace Hawke-eagle, still retain their discoverers&amp;rsquo; name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/borneo-jungle-lodge-18.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only a couple of hours drive from Sandakan we were dropped off at the Myne Resort and were immediately impressed. This luxury riverside cabin more than exceed our expectations and we were happy we booked to stay two nights instead of just one. &lt;br /&gt;From our cabin we had spectacular view overlooking Malaysia&amp;rsquo;s second longest river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/borneo-jungle-lodge-49.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we felt fully emerged in nature I was still troubled from our drive from Sandakan. Literally every available patch of fertile land had been turned into palm plantations. The scale of the farming is startling and as I began doing some research I found that vast quantities of pristine rainforest, home to hundreds and thousands of unique species, have been cut down rapidly over the past century to make way for plantations. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t long before my perfect riverside view was shattered as I began to spot more and more palm trees peeking out from the downstream river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/borneo-jungle-lodge-44.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The area is said to be the last alluvial floodplains in Asia making it an area of enormous importance. However, along with the plantations, logging and agricultural activities have meant the area has been under threat and many wild animals became displaced. Thankfully, in 2005, the area was finally named a Wildlife Sanctuary and awarded 26,000 hectors which are to remain protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/borneo-jungle-lodge-31.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our river boat trips we were lucky enough to see some amazing wildlife. We were captivated by the number of bright and beautiful birds of paradise we saw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/borneo-jungle-lodge-13.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unique shapes and colours of the three different species of hornbill we saw all contrasted against the blue skies and green trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/borneo-jungle-lodge-12.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also saw a few delicate and colourful kingfishers hovering near our boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/borneo-jungle-lodge-42.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an abundance of monkeys and we got to see various species as they played and drank by the water including the pig tailed macaque, the long tailed macaque, silver leaf monkey and red monkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/borneo-jungle-lodge-23.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also spotted plenty of Proboscis Monkeys which are native to the area. They are not hard to spot as they have a very distinctive nose. Also known as the Dutch monkey due to its unsually large nose and fat belly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/borneo-jungle-lodge-53.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also good to see a few nests where the orangutans lived, although we only managed to spot one next to our lodge. &lt;br /&gt;Our night safari didn&amp;rsquo;t start off too promising as in the beginning we only managed to spot insects, which seemed to be diving for us in the jeep, but towards the end we managed to spot a magnificent owl, wild boar, two wild cats and cute looking and slow moving nocturnal specialist the Lo Loris.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the morning of our last day we spotted plenty of crocodiles. Some were the size of our boat. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel the need to try and get closer to take photographs however the driver of the boat disagreed and crept up next to him before he spotted us and dived into the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="http://intrepidnomads.com/images/uploads/medium/borneo-jungle-lodge-37.jpg" alt=""  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, one of the reasons you are highly likely to see wildlife on the river is because many animals have been forced into this small corridor of protected land. Now I&amp;rsquo;m no eco warrior, in the past three months I have been on twelve flights and I have just bought two bottles of water and carried them in a plastic bag. I have a long way to go before I&amp;rsquo;m getting invited to any green peace party. However, it is clear to me that what humans are doing here is wrong. The basic economics of supply and demand tells me that there is no conspiracy; the large corporations are not cutting down the rainforests for no reason, as consumers we continue to demand these products, in this case palm oil. So maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just a case of educating ourselves to make better choices. Otherwise in a hundred years there may not be much rainforest left to see.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;To experience nature, while in Borneo, we booked a trip to the Kinabatangan River where we would spend three days / two nights staying at the Myne Riverside Resort. Our purpose of being there was to see the wildlife and with three river cruises, one night safari and one jungle walk planned we were certainly hopeful of spotting at least a few animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Everest Base Camp - Day 1 - Café Nero, Heathrow Departure Lounge </Title>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two and a half hours early in fact. How long will Caf&amp;eacute; Nero let me sip this coffee before they kick me out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/day-1-everest-base-camp-.jpg" alt="Test"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to make the most of this as in a few hours I will be joining a group of 28 people, most of whom I have only met once or not at all. I quite enjoy being alone, although, saying that, people do have some uses, such as helping to carry bags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have definitely packed too much. My bag is far too heavy. I have no idea how I&amp;rsquo;m going to get it down to 10kg for the flight to Lukla. It was great to find this out 2 days before departure which led to a frantic panic where I packed, re-packed, bought a new bag, packed, weighed it and packed again. I still don&amp;rsquo;t know if I have everything I need. Although judging by the current weight I will be wearing 6kg of clothes / equipment when boarding the flight to Lukla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m worrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worrying about the dissertation I have to write when I get back, worrying about being fit enough, worrying that I really should have tried to stop drinking and worrying about the fact that I have to spend 18 days with a bunch of strangers where the only thing we have in common is the company we work for. Why did I think it was a good idea to come away with people from work? Work is the one thing I am pleased to escape from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m even worried that I&amp;rsquo;m not excited enough. All week people have been asking me if I&amp;rsquo;m excited, nervous or scared. If I&amp;rsquo;m honest, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I am any of these. I am rarely emotionless but I do generally feel calm about the whole thing. Maybe it will all kick-in on the plane and I will start running around screaming &amp;lsquo;GET ME OFF!&amp;rsquo; I hope I don&amp;rsquo;t get stuck sitting next to someone who is really excited. I would hate to have to fake excitement, or worse, say something really negative so they shut up and stop annoying me. That would not be a good first impression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also had a realisation. I had always thought that I loved airports but what I really love is the ability to drink at any time of the day and for it to be totally acceptable. It&amp;rsquo;s not the same when you&amp;rsquo;re drinking coffee.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m early.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;I have my own room! Result! It&amp;rsquo;s by default though as two women in the group paid to have singles leaving an odd number, so I get a room to myself. I definitely need it. I feel like I have been travelling for days. Its 6.30pm (local time). I have had about 1hrs sleep, at the most. Even that hour was just me sitting uncomfortably on the plane with my eyes closed thinking &amp;lsquo;must get some sleep, must get some sleep&amp;rsquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to convince myself I have had some sleep in the past 24hrs but my body is having none of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/day-2-everest-base-camp-kathmandu.jpg" alt="Hotel In Katmandu"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing a room now would be testing. Although saying that, the group isn&amp;rsquo;t that bad. There are a lot of us and I have managed to attach myself to the two women who don&amp;rsquo;t work at the same company as the rest of us. One of them is the doctor, which is always handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flight has just been long, uncomfortable and filling. I feel like I have ate continuously since I left Manchester. Any weight loss I am expecting will not begin today.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;After a great night&amp;rsquo;s sleep at the hotel it was an early start (5.30am) to catch our flight to Lukla. I actually felt excited and ready to get into the trek. After some waiting around in the airport we boarded our flight which wasn&amp;rsquo;t half as bad as I had expected. We even had an air hostess on board. Flying in was like something out of Jurassic Park, you half expect a T-rex to pop out from somewhere. Despite the runway being frighteningly small we landed safely and were ready to begin the trek to everest base camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/Day-3-Lukla-Airport-Everest-Base-Camp.JPG" alt="Lukla Airport-Nepal"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first days trek was surprisingly easy, more like a gentle stroll, although, on a few of the steps I did start to feel the altitude. I certainly won&amp;rsquo;t be running anywhere fast anytime soon. The campsite is great, everything was set up when we arrived and we had a nice warm room to have our dinner in. If the trip carries on like this I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to exaggerate my story to the people who sponsored me when I get home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another luxury is I have my own tent, which despite my general hate for people did make me feel a bit sad&amp;hellip; only for a second though. Once inside I was able to pack and arrange all my things with tons of room. Needless to say some of the lads who have to share a tent have questioned why the smallest girl gets her own. Shit happens I guess. Although I may need someone in when it gets colder, but for now it&amp;rsquo;s great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so many porters, cooks and Sherpers doing pretty much everything for us I have never felt more British. They even fed us cheese sandwiches and spam for lunch. All I need now is my nightgown and pipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow is apparently one of the hardest days and will be a test for how well our bodies cope with the acclimatisation. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to a challenge as at the moment it feels a bit like a holiday (I realise I may regret saying this).&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

&lt;p&gt;I regret saying it was like a holiday! They were clearly easing us into a false sense of security until it was too far for us to turn back. Today has been hard, really hard. We have ascended 800m and the altitude has really kicked in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trek&amp;nbsp;to Namche bazzar&amp;nbsp;was amazing, the views were stunning. We walked past rivers, waterfalls, over suspension bridges in a lush green mountainous landscape. After another lovely dinner of potatoes, bread, cheese, beans and cabbage (strange mixture), things suddenly got harder. We walked up some steep stairs, then a steeper hill, all the while the air gets thinner and thinner. A few of the guys have got sick already. How they managed to make it to the campsite is beyond me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really started to feel the altitude in the last hour of walking. My head was foggy and I felt my fingers start to tingle. I was just thinking &amp;lsquo;please don&amp;rsquo;t let me be the one who gets ill&amp;rsquo;. My body literally did not want me to walk any further up. When we made it to camp I felt sick but after a cup of tea and a biscuit I started to feel normal again. This altitude business is really hard. It is also getting colder, much colder. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe this is day two, I feel like I have been here a lifetime already.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Everest Base Camp - Day 5- Namche Bazaar</Title>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Had another great night&amp;rsquo;s sleep, surprisingly as there were dogs barking outside my tent all night. Thank god I packed ear plugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woke up this morning to the most amazing views, we are literally meters away from the snow line. After a 10min walk we caught our first glimpse of the mighty mountain itself, Everest . It was AMAZING! I actually felt like crying as it finally dawned on me what we were about to do. This place is beautiful, my headache has cleared and I feel fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/Day-5-Evesrest-Base-Camp-Namche-Bazaar.JPG" alt="Amazing View Everest"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did an acclimatisation walk today. It was the first time I have tried out walking poles. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if I was going to get any, however after yesterday when one of the guys had to lend me one of his to literally drag myself up to the camp with, I thought it was a good idea to invest &amp;pound;12.50 in a pair. The walk was 400m high and quite steep, but we took it really slowly so I felt a lot better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking it slowly is defiantly the key, I woke up this morning and forgot how high we were and went speedily walking ahead, that lasted for 5 minutes before I was out of breath. There were more amazing views of Everest from the top. I actually found out for certain which one is Everest. Turns out I may have been pointing the wrong one out to people this morning. Ooops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a volleyball pitch at the top of the walk. Some of the guys from the group decided to play, they did really well for the 10 minutes they lasted. It was a nice walk with the sun shining down and best of all a hot shower waiting at the end. This hot shower consisted of a woman boiling water and manually pouring this into a plastic tank which filtered into a shower head. It was greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon we were free to explore Namche Bazaar. It&amp;rsquo;s a lovely place surrounded by mountains and it&amp;rsquo;s a shame we can&amp;rsquo;t stay longer. Hopefully I will get to come back one day as I would like to do the Annapurna circuit which is meant to be even better than base camp. I did some shopping for some Nepalese tat, after all you have to go home with a prayer wheel and a yak wool hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/Day-5(3)--Everest-Base-Camp-Namche-Bazaar.JPG" alt="Namche bazaar"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also progressively losing my mind. It&amp;rsquo;s crazy what the altitude does to you. I keep forgetting things (even more so than usual). While trying to enjoy some quality alone time I momentarily got lost and couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember the way back to the camp. There was a rush of utter panic until I managed to spot our team of Sherpers at the top of the hill. I&amp;rsquo;m blaming the altitude for this, but really, who knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also need to mention how grateful I am to have these teahouses to eat in. Apparently on Kilimanjaro and on other Everest base camp trips they eat in a mess tent. These teahouses are great, they are comfortable and heated (by burning yak shit) but they are definitely appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;WORST DAY EVER! I was sick. Really sick. Something at breakfast didn&amp;rsquo;t agree with me and I could feel it straight away on my stomach. As a result I was horrendously ill for the whole day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/Day-6(2)-Everest-Base-Camp-Thyangboche.JPG" alt="Thyangboche"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting to the lunch break, where I told them to keep their poisonous food away from me, was hard enough, but afterwards there was an uphill trek to the Ghompa (monastery). I honestly felt like I was on a pilgrimage and this was some kind of test. After being sick everything I had ate and drank I was exhausted. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t helped by the fact it was 28 degrees in the sun and about 5 in the shade. I was walking 3 steps and feeling like I was going to collapse. The Sherpers were fantastic. I cannot thank them enough, especially they guy who carried my bag. Having the poles was also a lifesaver, it definitely was &amp;pound;12.50 well spent. In all honesty I didn&amp;rsquo;t know if I was going to be able to make it, at some points I thought this monastery was a fictional place that Karmal (our guide) had made up. But I powered through, feeling extremely sorry for myself until at long last I reached the top. I could have cried but I had been holding the tears back for so long I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to break down. I was so happy to be in the tent and be able to lie down. Needless to say, I missed dinner and then slept for 10hrs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This day will go down as one of the worst in my life and it took a lot of effort both physically and mentally to be able to get through it. One major help for me was Donna (the Doctor), she was brilliant, although every tablet she gave me was making me sick again, and I thought she was trying to poison me. At one point a group of rebellious yaks broke loose and started running down the hill, when we saw one of the Sherpers hiding we knew we had a problem. I was so out of it at this stage I didn&amp;rsquo;t care if the yak ploughed me down. All I remember Donna saying, as I was hating my life, was that one day I would look back and laugh about this moment. Thankfully, this has proven to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was quite glad to hear the rest of the group found the afternoon walk hard. Apparently it was an 800m assent. Generally in the group people are dropping like flies with a mixture of altitude sickness, diarrhoea (so glad my sickness came up rather than down!) and gas. It really does make you question why we are putting our bodies through this.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Felt 100% better today. So glad it has passed as otherwise I would have questioned my ability to complete this trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was my favourite walk so far, we crossed into the snow line which for the past few days we have been looking up at. The views were outstanding, I don&amp;rsquo;t have enough adjectives in my vocabulary to be able to describe them in a way which will do it justice. I was just glad to be able to appreciate the scenery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a bit of bonding with my MD who is also on this trip, when some of the lads decided to climb this huge rock for a photo opportunity she suggested that we give it a go. I could hardly have said no, so with a scaffold of men helping us up, we did it. It&amp;rsquo;s a really great photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/Day-7-Dingboche(2)-Everest-Base-Camp.JPG" alt="photo on huge rock"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked to a German couple who said they didn&amp;rsquo;t make it to everest base camp or Kalapatthar. Not because of the weather (which reportedly is the worst weather for this time of year for 40 odd years) but because of abbesses on their feet. They said the hospital is full of sick people trying to get to everest base camp. After yesterday I can begin to imagine how they feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up last night to go to the toilet and forgot where I was. When I looked around the mountains of Dingboche they were lit up by the moon. They looked so ominous that I was actually frightened for a moment. The stars were out and you could clearly see the Milky Way. It was beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to write a bit about the Sherpers who are fabulous. They honestly cannot do enough for you. Karmal our guide is really easy going and friendly. My favourite Sherpa is Karam Sherpa. He is so small and cute and speaks the best English. He told me his name means the smallest star in the sky. Very appropriate. I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the name of the guy who carried my bag when I was ill but he is also a wonderful human being.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;I had another surprisingly great sleep, it was freezing so I went a bit OTT with the layers and it seemed to work. Today is another acclimatization day, we did a steep walk up to the top of a hill and back down. Apparently at the top the oxygen levels are 50% less than at sea level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people are getting ill in one way or another. The altitude is causing headaches and sickness. I&amp;rsquo;m so glad to be feeling fit and well again, even if I do stay off eggs and &amp;lsquo;meat&amp;rsquo; for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/Day-8-Dingboche-Everest-Base-Camp.JPG" alt="Dingboche Morning view"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlight of the day was washing my hair which was done using 3 bowls of water. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t elegant but it did the trick. I&amp;rsquo;m still surprised at how quickly I stopped caring what I looked like. I&amp;rsquo;m also shocked at how well I&amp;rsquo;m getting on with the group. I actually think that being in a big group has its advantages as you can spend the day floating around between different people. I&amp;rsquo;m almost certain that I&amp;rsquo;m not going to make any lifelong friends on this trip; you hear some stories of people growing close in these situations and sharing a bond for life. I like the people I&amp;rsquo;m with, but I can&amp;rsquo;t see this happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also learnt that I am a lone walker. In that I prefer to walk by myself rather than with someone talking. Part of this is to do with the altitude as it makes you out of breath, therefore walking and talking can sometimes be quite difficult, another part is the fact that I am enjoying plodding along at my own pace with my own crazy thoughts. Another guy on the base camp trip said he is a lone walker so it&amp;rsquo;s reassuring to know I&amp;rsquo;m not the only anti-social person.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Had another amazing night&amp;rsquo;s sleep and woke up feeling great. It was nice to have yesterday to relax, although the email I received from Karl made me miss him even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walk today has been my favourite so far. Everyone seems to be in great spirits and the scenery was out of this world. We hit the snowy track which was slippery but a bit more rural. I feel like I have fully acclimatised and can once again think straight. I have decided that I really want to come back to the Himalayas with Karl and do the Annapurna walk which is meant to be beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/Day-9(3)-Everest-Base-Camp-Loboche.JPG" alt="Locboche"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight we are sleeping in a tea house. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty grim, although we do have an on-suite (a squat toilet). I would describe the room as ruff&amp;hellip; at best. It is little more that ply boards nailed to 2 x 4 with a tin roof. I am also sharing with My MD which should be interesting. At least it&amp;rsquo;s just for a couple of nights. If I&amp;rsquo;m honest, I preferred the tent, but the snow is too deep to camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/Day-9(4)-Everest-Base-Camp-Loboche-.JPG" alt="Loboche Tea House"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s freezing cold now. We have reached the snow line which I think is low for this time of year due to the bad weather. More people are feeling the altitude today. After my day of hell I think everyone should go through at least some level of pain. Otherwise it would be too easy.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/Day-10-Gorakshep-Everest-Base-Camp.JPG" alt="Gorakshep"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The night was freezing cold. There was little point in the boarding round the &amp;lsquo;toilet&amp;rsquo; as I might as well have been pissing in the same room as my Managing Director. I have decided to take this opportunity to get to know her a bit more, she is a successful woman so maybe I can learn something from her. So far I have learnt that she is made of steel. Out of our group she is the one who hasn&amp;rsquo;t got ill once, she hasn&amp;rsquo;t even complained of a headache. Bloody basecamp will be a breeze for her, by the looks of it we will be holding her back from climbing to the top! I, on the other hand, am made from a softer metal, something a bit more malleable. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s a bad thing; I don&amp;rsquo;t even want to be a MD anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s walk was slippery but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too long, with only one steep assent. We made it to Gorakshep by lunchtime and there was very little to do. I can&amp;rsquo;t be bothered to talk to people, most of them annoy me now anyway. Luckily we have Everest Base Camp tomorrow and Kallapathar the day after, then it&amp;rsquo;s our home stretch back down.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;We did it! Today was the day we all trekked to Everest Base Camp. It was a slight anti-climax as there is actually nothing there apart from a few prayer flags (which are everywhere) and a group of Korean tourists. Apparently May is the climbing season where the place is a hive of activity. Also, you can&amp;rsquo;t actually see Everest from Everest Base Camp! You can kind of see the top if you get the right angle, squint, stand on one leg and whistle into the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/day-11-ebc-everest-base-camp.jpg" alt="Everest Base Camp Sign"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After what felt like a lifetime of photos being taken it was time to get down to the important business of rock hunting. Everyone at home wants a piece of Everest, except this won&amp;rsquo;t actually be Everest, but never mind, its close enough. So off I went in search for the perfect rocks to take home. I had been successful in finding a good range of rocks with flecks of sliver which glimmered in the sun. Perfect. Then Dave came along. Dave, I have to add is the guy in the group who has walked the entire way to Everest Base Camp in shorts. F**king shorts!! Anyway, Dave comes along with a rock with fleck of gold, so suddenly I&amp;rsquo;m searching for rocks with gold flecks. Brilliant. Found some. I&amp;rsquo;m pleased now as I have a good selection of rocks. The family will be pleased. Then Dave comes along again &amp;lsquo;look at this&amp;rsquo; he says , it&amp;rsquo;s a lovely flat rock, not too thick, not too thin, &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to get it engraved with Everest Base Camp and todays date&amp;rsquo;. This man is a genius! I now need a flat rock. This is more difficult to find. There seems to be a trend for writing messages on rocks which are left at base camp. Surely Dave couldn&amp;rsquo;t have found the only flat rock left. Getting increasingly frustrated I search around the area. Finally I find a suitable flat(ish) rock. Sorted. I can leave happy. Then short wearing Dave comes along again. I proudly tell him about my success at finding the perfect rock, when I notice a smile on his face, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to care about my rocks, he only goes and pulls out a rock SHAPED LIKE EVEREST! A f**ing Everest shaped rock!!&lt;br /&gt;I give up. Dave wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/day-11-ebc(2)-everest-base-camp.jpg" alt="Everest Base camp summit"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has found the perfect Everest Base Camp rock to take home. All I have to worry about now is how I&amp;rsquo;m going to carry my pockets full of inadequate rocks back to camp.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Everest Base Camp - Day 12 - Kalapatthar and Pherice (5,647m)</Title>
    <TitleURL>nepal/everest-base-camp-diary/everest-base-camp-day-12-kalapatthar-and-pherice-5647m</TitleURL>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;HARDEST DAY EVER! Reaching the summit of Kallapattar was a challenge. It was so cold, extremely cold in fact. Cold to the point where I thought I was going to die. I did it though. I made it to the top! But I was a mess. After a 4.30am start we were up and ready to conquer what looked like a giant mound of rocks rather than a mountain. Yesterday there was talk that it would be easy. I was ready to take it on, after all its just walking, how hard could it be? After about 45mins of walking we soon realised that this &amp;lsquo;mound of rocks&amp;rsquo; was a lot bigger than it first appeared. In fact what we saw from the bottom as &amp;lsquo;the top&amp;rsquo; was only half way up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/Day-12-Kalapatthar-(4)-Everest-Base-Camp.jpg" alt="Kalapatthar"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At about &amp;frac34; of the way up I had my first meltdown. I lost all sensation in my hands and couldn&amp;rsquo;t get my fingers out of my gloves to try and warm them on my palms. There was also the added problem that I had 2 poles attached to my wrists. The poles were useless as the ground was just massive icy boulders, so they did nothing to help. I had resorted to dragging them along the ground when I realised I couldn&amp;rsquo;t move my hands. I started to panic. Luckily one of the guys from our group came to save me. He took the redundant poles off me, sorted my gloves out and sent me back on my way to the top. He came and left like some kind of mountain superman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top of the mountain was still miles away and the altitude was making each step difficult. About 10m from the top I thought I was going to pass out. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t breathe and I was painfully cold, but with sheer determination I made it. My thought was that if I was going to pass out, I might as well pass out at the top. The reward was the magnificent view of Everest with the sun beginning to rise. I enjoyed this for the whole of 3 minutes while I tried not to break down, thankfully I was too exhausted and frozen to produce tears. I started to feel frighteningly cold at the top. I had lost my hands a while ago but my feet and face were now also gone, mixed with the lack of oxygen I thought my body was going into shut down. I had to get of this mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/Day-12-Kalapatthar(2)-Everest-Base-Camp.jpg" alt="Kalapatthar Trek"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I started to make my way down my feet felt like blocks of ice and I was falling all over the place. I actually thought that I may have to crawl down. Thankfully one of the Sherpers saw me struggling and came to my rescue. &amp;lsquo;Are you ok Leenee?&amp;rsquo; he asked. &amp;lsquo;I just want to be down&amp;rsquo; I replied, to which he grabbed my hand and literally dragged me down the mountain. Once the sun came over the mountains I began to regain feeling in my hands and feet, the pins and needles which ran through my body were excruciatingly painful, but once I realised I hadn&amp;rsquo;t lost any limbs I stopped walking. &amp;lsquo;What&amp;rsquo;s wrong?&amp;rsquo; asked the Sherper, &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;m just so happy&amp;rsquo;, I replied. I knew it was almost over and I had survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Himalayan peak conquered, we then began our decent back down. It was a long day of walking but I was still on a high from making it to the top of Kallapattar, even if I was a mess the entire way.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;HARDEST DAY EVER! Reaching the summit of Kallapattar was a challenge. It was so cold, extremely cold in fact. Cold to the point where I thought I was going to die. I did it though. I made it to the top! But I was a mess. After a 4.30am start we were up and ready to conquer what looked like a giant mound of rocks rather than a mountain. Yesterday there was talk that it would be easy. I was read...</ContentPreview>

&lt;p&gt;There was some drama today, just as we thought we were descending to safety one of the guys in our group collapsed and had a seizure. Luckily this was right outside the only hospital for hundreds of miles. It was such a shock as he is one of the fittest guys in the group and hasn&amp;rsquo;t complained about being ill once throughout this trip. Apparently, it was altitude induced. Once he came round they tried to put him on a horse but he was too unwell and a helicopter was called to take him back down to Kathmandu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just goes to show how dangerous this trip is and what we are putting our bodies through. I hope he is alright. He&amp;rsquo;s a nice guy, and he taught me how to play dice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was another long walk. We went back past the monastery where I was ill. It seems like a lifetime ago now, even though it was only a few days. Karma sharper took me inside, I was really lucky as I got to see the monks chanting. It was very calming yet powerful, with the continuous beating of the drum creating a spiritual atmosphere. I got blessed by the monks and left feeling happy, glad that I got to experience this on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight the tent seems damp and grim. I&amp;rsquo;m getting sick of the evenings, eating the same food, talking the same shit and playing the same crap games of cards.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

&lt;p&gt;Everyone seems in good spirits today. The end is in sight! Only two more nights in tents!! I&amp;rsquo;m certainly ready for home now. It was a relatively easy walk today with a stopover at Namche for some last minute shopping. There was an interesting yak stampede going down the hill. I definitely feel that I have had enough of yaks for a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Must try to enjoy these last few days. I have to say I was sad leaving the beautiful mountains. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to forget the magical scenery and how the landscape looks like it has been painted.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m off the mountains and back in civilisation!! Thank God! Half the group are still stuck in Lukla! So lucky that we were on the first flight as the one the others were booked on got cancelled due to bad weather. One way or another they need to get back today as our flight is tomorrow morning. There has been talk of helicopters going to get them if they can&amp;rsquo;t get a plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t stress enough how glad I am that I&amp;rsquo;m not stuck with them! I am thoroughly enjoying the Yak and Yeti hotel. I had the best shower ever after only having 2 &amp;lsquo;showers&amp;rsquo; over 2 weeks. I got to straighten my hair so I don&amp;rsquo;t have to wear a bloody hat anymore, and I also got to put some make-up on. I now feel like a woman again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our last day trekking went well, even if it had one too many uphill climbs. In the evening we had the &amp;lsquo;tipping ceremony&amp;rsquo; with the Sherpers and we donated our unwanted items which they raffled off. I give them my sleeping mat, my fleece liner and them useless gloves. We all drank and thankfully didn&amp;rsquo;t have to sleep in tents as we were in an ok(ish) teahouse. Some of the rooms even had a bathroom with a shower, which has become a strange concept.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;In 2012 we spent 7 days travelling through the captivating country of Jordan. This trip was not inspired by our need for Christian enlightenment, but rather by Karl Pilkington in An Idiot Abroad. This T.V programme showed the lost kingdom of Petra as one of the 7 Wonders of the World and we were immediately intrigued. Bordering both Syria, Iraq and Israel, Jordan had never came to the top of our holiday destination list, however, after some research into the area we found that it was both safe and welcoming for tourists, something which is avidly promoted by King Abdullah II.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Our research also led us to discover that Petra was only one of a number of sights this country has to offer, with both the Roman city of Jaresh, the Wadi Rum desert, and the Dead Sea being added to our 'must see' list. The country had the perfect mix of antiquity and natural wonders which would keep us both suitably satisfied.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Despite preferring DIY travelling we decided to go for a tour as our time was limited and we didn't want the hassle of organising it ourselves. On this occasion I would say that it was the best decision as we managed to fit in all our 'must see' places as well as being taken to other equally enchanting places such as the Dana Biosphere Reserve. This came as an added surprise when we saw how beautiful the place was. We arrived at the Dana just as the sun was about to set were able to sit on our balcony with the most spectacular views. This ended up being one of the best moments of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/petra-jordan-couple.jpg" alt="Outside Petra"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jordan is well famed for its biblical references; however this was not the focus of our trip. For those who follow such religions both the River Jordan and Moses burial place would be worth a visit. We were happy with walking the ruins of Petra, meandering through the rock faces to discover yet more ancient architectures. For those looking to go it is well worth noting that the climb up the stairs to the Monastery is well worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other highlights included following the footsteps of Lawrence of Arabia by camping with the local Bedouins under the stars in the desert and feeling weightless in the Dead Sea. It has to be said that floating in the Dead Sea is only as relaxing as it looks in the photographs before you get the water in your eyes. After that point it's blind scramble back to the shore with mud and salt increasing burning out your eye sockets. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With all these sights to take in Jordan is by far a perfect holiday for those looking for a cultural experienced set in a diverse landscape of outstanding natural beauty.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Italy - A land of Antiquity (and really good wine) </Title>
    <TitleURL>italy/travel/italy-a-land-of-antiquity-and-really-good-wine</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2014-06-03T18:17:02.07+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Italy is a country to indulge in. Indulge in the culture, the beautiful coastlines, the food, and of course, the wine. Over the course of our 2 week jaunt we certainly managed to fit in as much of these indulgences as we possibly could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our trip began in the colourful city of Naples. Naples often has a bad reputation as being noisy, chaotic and dangerous and I have no doubt that on occasions these are true, however looking beyond these negative stereotypes, Naples is a city full of charm, character, great food and classic Italian architecture. Our hotel was situated in the bohemian area of Piazza Bellini which is a perfect place to sit outside at one of the many bars and soak up the true Italian atmosphere. The gastronomic highlight of Naples was DiMatteos where we were assured the best pizzas in the world were made. We were not disappointed. &lt;br /&gt;From Naples we made a day trip to Herculaneum which is the smaller of the two ancient towns devastated by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius back in 79 AD. This is defiantly worth a visit to those with enough time, it is less crowded than it more famous neighbour Pompeii and just as fantastic. Both towns are one of the few places in the world where you can step back in time and gain an appreciation of what life was really like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaving Naples we headed north to the heart of the ancient empire, the great city of Rome. Every corner you turn in Rome you come face to face with another ancient wonder, at times you can actually become blinded to it all, especially as everywhere you try to sit and relax with some food or a drink will cost you an extortionate amount of money. In the end we resorted to the Italian style we picked up on in Naples. Who needs to sit in an overpriced restaurant and pay 20 euros for one drink when you can head to the local Spar, buy a bottle of Peronei, and sit at one of the numerous squares while taking in all the ancient splendour, without begrudgingly paying 40% extra for table service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All ruined out, we then headed back south to spend our final week relaxing on the stunning Amalfi coast. We stayed in Sorrento, and after days of sight seeing it was nice to slow the pace down and take time to relax, sunbath, drink wine and visit the delights of the coast. Over the week we visited Capri, the island of the rich and famous, the charming town of Amalfi and the picturesque Positano.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>10 Essential Items to Pack for a Trek to Everest Base Camp</Title>
    <TitleURL>nepal/walking-and-trekking/10-essential-items-to-pack-for-a-trek-to-everest-base-camp</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2014-08-30T09:54:48.933+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;h3&gt;10. Hat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I packed 3 which was slightly excessive. If you have room I would recommend a cap for the day and a wool hat for the evenings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;9. Neck gaiter / scarf&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A thermal neck gaiter is ideal for when it gets cold at night. I also bought a tube scarf in Namche Bazaar for about 50p (a lot cheaper than the shops in the UK). This turned out to be invaluable as it helps protect against sunburn on your neck and can also be used to cover your face to protect against wind chill. You can apparently wear it in 13 different ways, or more, depending on how creative you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;8. Socks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking after your feet is vital when on a long trek, so invest in good socks. You won&amp;rsquo;t be able to fit a pair for everyday in your backpack (unless you don&amp;rsquo;t take anything else). So be realistic about the amount you want to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. Gloves&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a whole array of gloves you can get and it was one of the items on my kit list that left me confused. I ended up getting two pairs, one lighter thermal pair for during that day and another thicker pair, almost like skiing gloves. &lt;br /&gt;My budget for the trip was going slightly out of control when I went to buy the thicker gloves so I made the mistake of opting for a cheaper pair. This was a mistake. Although there was only one day when I wore them (on the walk up Kallapattar) I immediately knew I should have invested in a better quality pair. I definitely wish I hadn&amp;rsquo;t scrimped on the gloves on that day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Walking Boots&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These must be well worn in. I recommend taking a spare pair of laces and plenty of plasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Sleeping bag&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be an expensive item but it&amp;rsquo;s well worth the investment. Look for at least -10 for comfort. Keep an eye out for deals on the internet, especially in the summer when these items can be reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Head torch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DON&amp;rsquo;T GO WITHOUT ONE!! This is a must! It gets dark really early and walking around from tent/teahouses to &amp;lsquo;toilets&amp;rsquo; in the dark is difficult. &lt;br /&gt;Also take a hand torch. If you are sleeping in a tent you can hang this from the top to give you some light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Down Jacket&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another expensive item, but essential for when the sun goes down as it gets really, really cold. I took a Northface 600 down jacket and this was more than enough. I bought it in the sale and then sold it on Ebay when I got back for &amp;pound;20 less than what I paid for it. There are loads of second hand ones available on line and you won&amp;rsquo;t have any problem reselling it if you keep it in decent condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Metal water bottle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a water bladder but didn&amp;rsquo;t use it that much as the water doesn&amp;rsquo;t taste great. Instead I relied on a metal water flask. This item really came into its own in the evenings when the Sherpers boil hot water and fill it up. Take this to your sleeping bag about an hour before you want to go to bed and it will make it a lot more inviting to get into. The water flask will be very hot too touch so be careful if you do try this! &lt;br /&gt;All the water you drink is boiled first, unless you buy bottled water which increases in price the higher you get and isn&amp;rsquo;t good for the environment. Therefore by doing it this way it also means that you will have nice chilled water for the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Walking poles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never use walking poles when hiking in the UK but when it got to day 3 and I was struggling with the altitude the poles helped a lot. You may not use them all the time but they are worth having, particularly if you are ill, tired or aching as it will help take the pressure off your feet for a bit. At some points when my legs were weak and I was feeling ill I honestly felt like the only way I kept going was by dragging myself up with the poles. &lt;br /&gt;I bought mine in Namche Bazaar, they weren&amp;rsquo;t great quality and fell apart by the end of the trip but for &amp;pound;12.50 I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too upset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;h3&gt;10. Hat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I packed 3 which was slightly excessive. If you have room I would recommend a cap for the day and a wool hat for the evenings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;9. Neck gaiter / scarf&lt;/h3&gt;

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s July in Edinburgh, its 16&amp;deg;C and it&amp;rsquo;s raining. However, this does not dampen our spirits, only our clothes. Edinburgh is a beautiful city even with grey skies and, more importantly, there is plenty of Whiskey to keep to us warm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/drinking_whiskey_taster.jpg" alt="leanne whiskey tasting"  height="1752" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scotland is famous for its Whiskey, referred to as Scotch. This greatly exported product comes in four different varieties, each from a different region of Scotland. These are Lowland, Highland, Speyside and Islay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Scotch Whiskeys from the Lowland are citrusy in flavour, lighter and milder than other types, often including grassy tones. Those from the Highland extend all the way up to the Orkney Islands, these Scotches are more sweet and floral in flavour with hints of honey and caramel. Speyside is a popular region for Scotch as the fertile lands means it is easy to grow barleys. The flavours in theses Scotches tend to be more fruity and tropical, including flavours such as apple and banana. Finally, there are the Scotches from the Islay Island which are distinctly rich and smoky with strong tastes of peat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As well as the different regions there are also the various types of malts and blends. These include Blended whiskeys, Malt whiskeys, Grain whiskeys, Single Malt and Pure (vatted) Malt. Out of these it is the Blended whiskeys that take up 90% of the sales. &lt;br /&gt;With all the different regions and blends it is easy to see how lovers of Whiskey can appreciate the Scotch which the country has to offer. However, those of us who have not yet acquired the pallet for such a drink can tend to miss out on the hints of flavours as mentioned above for a strong anti-septic taste followed by a burning sensation at the back of the throat. Although, maybe I just haven&amp;rsquo;t drank enough of it yet.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Is Naples Safe For Tourists</Title>
    <TitleURL>italy/travel/is-naples-safe-for-tourists</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2014-09-01T20:10:00.037+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Did we set out to go to Naples? no. But with the cheapest flights from the UK, Rome to the north, Pompei next door and the Amalfi coast around corner. Naples was the most economical way into this historical region of Italy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/naples_museum_phalice.jpg" alt="Phalice in the museum"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little I knew of Naples involved shootings, extortion and Mafiosi namely the Camorra. The stabbing of British football fans by football hooligans reported in the press. The odd historical reference in relation to some long lost roman emperor, the passing though of Richard the lion heart on his way to partake in crusades and the French occupation under Napoleon. My knowledge of Naples was patchy at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compound these violent tales with stories from others who have visited the city &amp;ldquo;I did not feel safe&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;the place is dirty&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;there is graffiti everywhere&amp;rdquo;, it would be easy to conclude that avoidance would be the best policy. Perhaps Naples was not a safe place to visit as a tourist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/naple_street_graffiti.jpg" alt="Naples view of the street graffiti"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I little bit of research later and my curiosity was ignited. Naples city centre was a UNSECO World Heritage site, hardly surprising for a city with 2800 years of history. With 448 historical churches, a wealth of castles, palaces, museums and piazzas as well as being the home of the pizza surely a taste of Italy could be found in Naples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Undeterred we booked a hotel for 3 nights in the Piazza Bellini neighbourhood before heading onwards to Rome and then Sorrento. On arrival via taxi it&amp;rsquo;s hard not to notice that every car has been dinted. Stories of the Camorra ransoming cars presumably means keeping your car discreet has its benefits. Tales of graffiti everywhere were certainly true, even the historic centre was unable to escape the distinct spraying of paint. Perhaps this added to the effect, but the city was a little dirty, but certainly no more than any other European city. Although at the time I hardly noticed, I have been to places far worse in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/naples_castle.jpg" alt="Naples castle"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking nothing of the city&amp;rsquo;s bad reputation we wandered the cobbled, narrow streets of the historic centre. Shops squeezed into the ground floors of the four story houses selling religious trinkets, gelato and pizza. Historic churches were on every corner, evidently still a part of the Neapolitan culture, it had the vibe of a religious city. Imposing castles lined the harbour (Lungomare\Bayfront) surrounding Naples, the sun shone bright, the shadow of Vesuvius cast across the bay while Neapolitans frequented the seaside restaurants. This certainly did not feel the dangerous place portrayed to me.&amp;nbsp;Then there was the Naples National Museum of Archaeology, the most important museum in Italy, it contains the most intact artefacts from the Roman and Greek periods in the world. Most of the artefacts were found in nearby Herculaneum and Pompeii. This was one of the best museums I have visited, the lack of other visitors only made it more pleasurable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/naples_museum_living_vs_statue.jpg" alt="Naples museum selfie"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was still yet to see the danger but perhaps it is easy for me to see past what would make others feel unsafe, there is touts, and people who will befriend you just to steel your belongings. Like any other major city just keep to your self have your wits about you, dress down, don&amp;rsquo;t make yourself stand out in the crowd. And yes there is pick pockets, especially at the garibaldi station. They are very easy to spot, just remember to keep your belongings safe.&lt;br /&gt;So is Naples safe&amp;nbsp;for tourists?&amp;nbsp;In truth I never felt unsafe the entire time. There is clearly issues with petty crime but this is the case in any city. Yes there is graffiti and rubbish in places, if you can look beyond this you will find the most interesting of cities packed full of history, architecture, character and good pizza.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Essentials Items to Pack for a Mount Toubkal Trek</Title>
    <TitleURL>morroco/walking-and-trekking/essentials-items-to-pack-for-a-mount-toubkal-trek</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2014-09-27T11:10:41.533+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;We spent 5 days trekking in the Atlas Mountains of Morroco with the main goal being&amp;nbsp;the ascent of mount Toubkal, the highest mountain in North Africa. This is not a definitive list of what kit to pack but what I found most useful during my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gloves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/toubkal_gloves.jpg" alt="toubkal kit list gloves"   /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although you&amp;nbsp;would not have thought so looking at the the summit of Toubkal from the comfortable warmth of the foothills, at altitude it was freezing cold and incredibly windy. If I could have took a thicker pair of gloves I would have, at least I was not reduced to wearing socks on my hands as some of the more unfortunate members were forced to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hiking Boots and Socks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/hiking-boots-toubkal.jpg" alt="boots for climbing toubkal"   /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would not go any walk without them (even in hot weather), good worn in boots and thick hiking socks prevent blisters. A fresh pair of socks can feel amazing so pack more than 1 pair. Boots also provide ankle support and good grip to stop you falling. Simple but most effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Good Book&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/toubkal-book.jpg" alt="book of secrets"   /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to do at night? With walking finishing in the early afternoon the rest of the day is yours to do as you please, in the middle of the Atlas mountains there&amp;rsquo;s really not a lot to do. A good book provided pleasing entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaseline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/toubkal_vaseline.jpg" alt="vaseline is essential"   /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chafing can be a real pain and was for me, the straps from my backpack caused skin chafing across the chest\shoulder area. Vaseline really helped to ease the pain. The smallest discomforts can feel twice as bad when walking so always be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fleece&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/toubkal_fleece-jacket.jpg" alt="warm fleece"   /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took two and used both with a jacket on top, believe me it was cold towards the top. Even if you have a warm day always take extra layers just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zip off Shorts\Trousers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/toubkal_zip_trousers.jpg" alt="usable trek trousers"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took one pair for the whole trip, when it was hot the bottoms zipped off and they became shorts. Very useful when at lower altitudes as it&amp;rsquo;s very hot. When the weather was colder I wore them as trousers. For night times I took a pair of comfortable jogging pants which was one of the better ideas I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking Poles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/toubkal-trekking-poles.jpg" alt="walking poles"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no use for walking poles on the way up, on the way down they were a god send. Although I thought my legs where strong I ended up with a lot of knee pain on the descent. The poles really took the pressure off, if only I had used them throughout perhaps my knees would have survived a bit longer. We only took poles that where &amp;pound;6 each (from Decathlon) just to try them out, in the end they were worth every penny, we even donated them to one of the locals after we had finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wet Wipes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/toubkal-wet-wipes.jpg" alt="wet wipes"   /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bad case of diarrhoea and no toilet roll, no more explanation needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sun Cream&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/toubkal_sun_cream.jpg" alt="sun cream for kit list"   /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must have unless you want to cause yourself unnecessary suffering, on the same point a hat can also help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Torch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/toubkal_torch.jpg" alt="head torch for Toubkal"   /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just took a small hand held torch which was fine for me, most others had head lamps but this was going to be an extra expense so the handheld sufficed. For the final ascent we set off in the dark, those without light had rely on the light from other group members, an awkward situation considering we were&amp;nbsp;scrambling over rocks. A torch&amp;nbsp;also allows you to read when the sun goes down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wind Proof \ Water Proof Coat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/toubkal_hiking_jacket.jpg" alt="water proof coat"   /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is something I questioned would be useful in Morocco, how wrong was I. Although what rain fell was fairly sporadic and hardly sustained the main benefit was the wind protection. The wind on Toubkal was perhaps the strongest I have ever felt, at one point I was literally blown off my feet and ended up lying down on the side of the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Essential Items&amp;nbsp;I Should Of Packed But Didn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imodium&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/toubkal_imodium_.jpg" alt="essential kit imodium"   /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all happened 30 minutes before the trek began, while everyone was prepared to go I was becoming acquainted with the inside of the toilet cubicle. Luckily I was able to borrow some Imodium, without it I feel the story would be very much different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some nice food\snacks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/toubkal_snacks.jpg" alt="kendal mint cake"   /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was hungry most of the trip and regretted not bringing my own snacks, there is however a plentiful supply of mars bars and Pringles at base camp to accompany the food served at base camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antihistamine Tablets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/toubkal_allergy_tablet.jpg" alt="allergy tablets"   /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone whose body decides it is allergic to a host of everyday things you would have thought I would have been prepared. Clearly not for when I had a reaction there was not much I could do, a simple wash in cold water had to suffice. A pair of sun glasses came in useful to protect my eyes from dust and pollen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Toubkal Day 1 – Aremd 1800m </Title>
    <TitleURL>morroco/mount-toubkal-diary/toubkal-day-1-aremd-1800m</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2014-10-25T19:11:54.457+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Once again I find myself up in the mountains. This time I the aim of the trip is to conquer North Africa&amp;rsquo;s highest peak, Mount Toubkal. This trip has come about as a result of my expedition to Everest Base Camp last year. As Karl had come on many walking trips with me as part of my training, but never got to experience the finale at Base Camp, he was understandably keen to hike up a mountain a bit bigger than Ben Nevis. I was also keen to get some more use out of our expensive stack of walking paraphernalia. After throwing around some ideas we finally settled on Mount Toubkal, this was a slight compromise as I could have been halfway up Kilimanjaro by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite my best intentions I haven&amp;rsquo;t done any training for this trip, after months spent hiking, Spinning and Body Pumping last year, in preparation for Everest Base Camp, this year I&amp;rsquo;m lucky if I have made it to Bums n Tums once a week. Now that we have just completed day one I&amp;rsquo;m already beginning to regret not putting more effort into increasing my fitness levels. I just kept thinking that if I made it through 14 days in the Himalayas last year, I&amp;rsquo;m sure this trip will be fine. This blas&amp;eacute; attitude may soon backfire on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have booked this trek as an organised tour, so once again I find myself stuck with a bunch of strangers who we are forced befriend for the next 5 days. I always say I&amp;rsquo;m not doing an organised tour again, yet here we are. I have already seen a couple who boarded our plane from Manchester doing the same trek, just them and a guide. Why didn&amp;rsquo;t we just do that? Now we have to sit through night after night of arguments over how we to play 21 and what the &amp;lsquo;rules&amp;rsquo; are for Sh*thead. The advantage this time is that I have Karl, and the general rule is that couples don&amp;rsquo;t have to mingle as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today we have been taken by bus from Marrakech to the foothills of the Atlas Mountains. We had a steep 1hr walk before lunch when we arrived at our gite. This is a simply furnished guest house with dorm style rooms. Luckily there was enough space for me and Karl to have our own room. The outside terrace is lovely with some amazing views of the mountains. Although it&amp;rsquo;s simple, it is a lot nicer than I imagined, so I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to be spending 2 nights here. In the afternoon we went for a walk around the local village, nothing too strenuous. It felt nice to be out walking after spending the past 2 days starfished on a sun lounger.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Today we did an acclimatisation walk to the top of one of the mountains near to our gite. Thankfully, luck was on our side and it was overcast for most of our assent. It was undoubtedly hot though and the regret for not taking my training seriously began to mount up. Everyone on the trip is a bloody marathon runner! I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it was the altitude or not but I certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t feel fit doing the walk today. I&amp;rsquo;m also less encouraged by the fact the guide said Toubkal is a lot harder than today&amp;rsquo;s trek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We only went to 2600m today. Tomorrow we go to 3000m. I do question why I do these things. On the way up I was thinking how hard it was and then on the way down, when I was sliding all over the place and falling on my arse, I did have a moment why I thought, why am I doing this? Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m here now so I&amp;rsquo;m determined to get to the top. I just have to focus on the celebratory drink we can have when we get back to Marrakesh.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Content>&lt;p&gt;We made it to the top of Mount Toubkal! This was not without its difficulties. I have to admit I may have massively underestimated this trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/medium/toubkal_summit-group.jpg" alt="Mount Toubkal summit group photo"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting a top the summit of Toubkal for a group photo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was a nice walk from Aremd to get to the base camp. The total assent was 1200m over 6hrs at a nice pace, and we comfortably arrived by lunch time. Base Camp has 2 choices of accommodation, option 1 is considerably newer than the other more &amp;lsquo;rustic&amp;rsquo; building. Obviously we knew which one we would be staying in. As we went to dump our bags in the hovel we were staying at, we found out the group would be sleeping in one dorm room, all 14 of us! Immediately before entering the building we were told to guard all our belongings as even socks tend to go &amp;lsquo;missing&amp;rsquo; from this place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the afternoon we had the option to go on an acclimatisation walk, so with nothing else to amuse ourselves with we decided to go. I was tired and full from lunch, as the walk turned increasingly difficult I actually began to regret leaving the grimy lodge. We eventually got to a point where there was a 300m steep assent. The guide really sold it to us by saying its hard and it will be both cold and windy at the top. Alternately you could just walk back. He asked for a raise of hands for those who wanted to go back. My lone hand rose, obviously this group of fitness freaks would want to go to the top. Is Mount Toubkal not enough for these people?! I bet they want to jog up as well. Anyway, another woman looked slightly relieved when she saw my hand up and offered to walk back with me. So I didn&amp;rsquo;t get lost of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For tea we literally had a pot of curried lentils and pasta. I think the cook is having a laugh knowing that we are all sleeping in one room tonight!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We awoke for the summit climb at 5am. I had seen the path we were going on yesterday and it already looked terrifying enough without doing it in the dark. Of course the batteries decided to go on my head torch so I spent most of the morning arguing with Karl as to who was going to get the hand torch. We did have a back-up plan but that involved climbing with a wind up torch which wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been the most practical for scrambling over the rocks. When we did set off it was dark, cold and there were sheer drops around me. We were expected to scramble then walk along a narrow path with gale force winds blowing us around. This all resulted in me having a slight panic attack. I had wrapped myself up in so many layers and combined with the altitude I did at one point think that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t breathe. I had to stop and tear some clothes off and clam myself down. At this moment I questioned if I was actually going to make it to the top, considering we had only been walking for 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once we got past the first precarious section the sun came out and the path did level out slightly. Thankfully we took a really slow pace so I could breathe normally and I didn&amp;rsquo;t suffer from any altitude headaches. I did feel slightly nauseous but I think that was due to the lentils having their effect on the group. I soon began to believe there was a possibility I could make it to the top. After a long slog with battering winds, where I spent most of the time questioning why the hell I was putting myself through this, we did eventually make it to the top. It was freezing and I was glad I had lugged my down jacket to the top which, along with all my other layers, made it just bearable to sit there for a while, soaking in the sense of achievement. Others in the group were not so well prepared for the cold and one guy was reduced to wearing another man&amp;rsquo;s socks on his hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we made our way down the path the winds picked up and I genuinely feared that I would be blown of the mountain. The path was relentless, just small rocks and scree making every step like it was on ice. I fell over a lot! At one point I fell on my arse 3 times without move an inch. I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t step forward without falling over! Thankfully one of the guides helped me get past this recurring nightmare I was living in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked very, very, slowly down the mountain, Karl hurt his knee and he still walked faster than me. When I did eventually make it to the bottom there was a beautiful waterfall which we had missed when we set off in the dark. Once I reached the water a fantastic sense of relief came over me. At last it was over!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Flag Biére- Marrakesh </Title>
    <TitleURL>morroco/drink-reviews/flag-biére-marrakesh</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-03-05T08:52:44.333+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Not known for its drinking culture, Marrakesh is more about mint teas than mojitos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We soon found that each hour spent in the Souks made the forbidding beverage become more and more tempting. This was not helped by the fact that we had spent two days in a hotel which didn&amp;rsquo;t serve alcohol. There is a similar theme with restaurants, in particular those located around the Medina as it is local law that alcohol should not be consumed openly in view of the mosque. &lt;br /&gt;However, lovers of liquor, do not despair! Alcohol can be found, it&amp;rsquo;s just not advertised as prominently as it is in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/images/uploads/original/flag-biere.jpg" alt="Flag Bierre"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit I was probably I little bit too excited when we changed hotels and found a bar serving beer. There were two options available, the first was the popular Dutch beer Heineken, and the second cheaper option was the local &amp;lsquo;Bi&amp;eacute;re Flag&amp;rsquo;. It was the latter which became our drink of choice for the remainder of our time in Marrakesh. Enjoying our cool beers in the riads courtyard became the perfect relaxing setting to enjoy this rare delight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course tourism has meant that Marrakesh does now have its fair share of bars and newly formed clubs, but these are still few and far between. Drinking is not the reason you would go to Morocco. However, if you do fancy something to cool you down and take the edge off the chaos of the Medina, or to celebrate after a long trek though the Atlas Mountains, then a Bi&amp;eacute;re Flag can be highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Why should you write a travel blog?</Title>
    <TitleURL>na/plan-your-own-trip/why-should-you-write-a-travel-blog</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-03-09T10:09:06.703+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/write-travel-blog.jpg" alt=""   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There a number of mixed emotions that come out when you first tell someone you&amp;rsquo;re going to write a travel blog. You can see the thoughts running through people&amp;rsquo;s minds. I like to think these are mainly positive things, such as, &amp;lsquo;This will be a really good way to store your memories and keep in contact with people from back home&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;What a fun way to create something which will inspire and inform other travellers&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are also darker thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the thoughts that creep up on some people who may not be having the best of days when you break the news. They had probably just came to terms with the fact you were leaving to travel the world and now you are telling them that there will be a place on the internet where they can be reminded of this at any time of the day. These thoughts will go more like this;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;First they tell us they are going travelling, now they want us to read about all the fun they are having and how f*cking fantastic their life. What a pair of Egotistical ****s!&amp;rsquo; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this is true. I have friends who have been travelling and I remember the feeling you get when you arrive at work on a Monday morning after fighting your way through traffic in the pouring rain, not being able to find a parking space, having to drive 10 minutes away from your office only to realise you don&amp;rsquo;t have a umbrella and end up sitting at your desk, sodding wet, ready to face another stress filled week. At this point you turn on your phone and see 20 updates on Facebook from your friends who are lying on a beach in Thailand surrounded by empty cocktail glasses complaining because the weather is too hot. Surly these narcissists can&amp;rsquo;t be your friends!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have decided that it is important that this blog does not come across as another condescending and pretentious travel blog. So if it&amp;rsquo;s not a way to brag and moan what exactly are the reasons behind us starting a blog?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have made a list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Something to do whilst on the road&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is safe to say that when travelling for any long period of time there will be moments when you feel bored. After working 10 hours a day for years the sudden amount of free time which becomes available can be daunting. Obviously, most of this time will be filled with the activities which travelling entails, but in-between are long bus/train/boat/aeroplane journeys and days when you just can&amp;rsquo;t bring yourself to look at another temple. Also, if you aren&amp;rsquo;t restricted by an end date it is sensible to travel slower as this can work out cheaper. Having a project such has the blog to work on can help to fill those free days and potentially add many more onto your journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Record memories&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a tattoo on my back which supposedly says &amp;lsquo;memories last forever&amp;rsquo; in Thai. As I get older I realise this is not necessarily true. I look back at photographs and don&amp;rsquo;t know what country they were taken in, never mind trying to remember the name of the town or the people I&amp;rsquo;m with. &lt;br /&gt;When I came back from my first trip to India I made a scrap book. I cut out the pages from the Lonely Planet guide of the places I had been to and stuck these next to the photographs, along with any tickets, leaflets ect which had been picked up along the way. I love this book so much, and every time I look at it, it brings back all those precious moments. To me this blog is the modern way to keep a scrap book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Keep in contact with friends and family&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course we want to share our experiences with our friends and family, and there is only so much you can fit into a Skype call. We plan on travelling for as long as our budget will allow us. The downside of travelling is you can&amp;rsquo;t take all the people you love with you. This blog allows our friends and family to be able to keep in contact and see what we are up to. &lt;br /&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s if they want to read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Further our skills&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travelling will undoubtedly enrich your understanding of the world and broaden you mind, but what else can we learn on the way? Karl works in IT and wanted to develop his skills in website creation and design and we are both keen to learn how to become travel writers. A much as we would like to, we are not going to be travelling forever. We will be going back to work. It is therefore important that we keep learning skills which we can apply professionally. Spending a year or more travelling the world isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing on your CV, but having a tangible end product which is something that you have created will help to show future employers that you didn&amp;rsquo;t just spend the entire time starfished on a sun lounger drinking beer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Make some cash?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/travel-money-tips-458x250.jpg" alt="Make some Money"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are numerous website and books out there which tell you how you can make money from writing blogs. Over the years people have been able to make a living out of successful travel blogs which have enabled them to travel longer and open up further business opportunities. This is certainly not our aspiration, however, we would not turn down the opportunity to make a bit of cash while on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your only driver is to make cash from the blog then you need to treat it like a business. You need to understand your target market, and be willing to put a lot of hours into developing it. I think we both want to enjoy the freedom from responsibilities too much to commit ourselves to doing this just yet, but it&amp;rsquo;s always an option for the future.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>How to choose a name for your travel blog</Title>
    <TitleURL>na/plan-your-own-trip/how-to-choose-a-name-for-your-travel-blog</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-03-25T14:46:30.287+00:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Coming up with a name for a blog can be extremely difficult. Do you go with something that is;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;Clear, concise and easy to remember.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;Something which is unique, quirky and represents your personality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;Just go for whichever domain name is available at the time that doesn&amp;rsquo;t cost an arm and a leg to run.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;rsquo;m honest, I think our blog tile is a mixture of all the above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I had originally put &amp;lsquo;Travel Without a Coat&amp;rsquo; on the table, as I thought this was a cleaver, quirky idea which picked up on the stereotypical view that people from Newcastle don&amp;rsquo;t wear coats. I also thought that it fitted nicely with our dream to get away from the cold damp weather of the UK. Although some people agreed with me there was a lot that didn&amp;rsquo;t get it, so this I idea was swiftly vetoed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next, we produced the following list of blog titles;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;TravelFit &amp;ndash; Free Independent Travel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Open Road&amp;ndash; Taking the Road Less Traveled&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barmy Backpackers &amp;ndash; Two Geordies Let Loose&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moaning Backpacker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where Ever I Lay My Hat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Independent Backpackers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Travel Smart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;For The Love of Travel &amp;ndash; The Backpacking Couple&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go BackPacker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Love the Road &amp;ndash; The Journey Of a back Packing Couple&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Love the Journey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Travellers Together&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Travel Together&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;LoveToRoam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Geordie Globe Trotters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;We Are Travellers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;We Are nomads&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adventure Together&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wandering Souls &amp;ndash;The Budget Backpacking Couple&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are wandering stardust&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Travelling Stardust&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wandering Stardust&amp;ndash;The Budget Backpacking Couple&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;World Aliens &amp;ndash; Lost In Paradise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earth Warriors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s right, at one point, after a few too many glasses of wine, we had actually considered calling our blog &amp;lsquo;Earth Warriors&amp;rsquo;!! Thankfully the domain name was already taken.&amp;nbsp;After much debate we finally settled on Intrepid Nomads, which, conveniently, also was also a cheap, available website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what does Intrepid Nomads actually mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intrepid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; - Fearless; adventurous (often used for rhetorical or humorous effect) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nomads&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;A member of a people that travels from place to place to find fresh pasture for its animals and has no permanent home&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;- A person who does not stay long in the same place; a wanderer:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(Oxford Dictionary, 2015)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well we certainly aren&amp;rsquo;t fearless and we don&amp;rsquo;t own animals. However, there are undoubtedly, some true reflections of our personalities in these definitions. &lt;br /&gt;And on the positive side, even if it is just used for &amp;lsquo;rhetoric or humorous effect&amp;rsquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s only costing us &amp;pound;2.99 a month to run.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;Something which is unique, quirky and represents your personality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    <Title>Starting to save for your budget backpacking trip</Title>
    <TitleURL>na/plan-your-own-trip/starting-to-save-for-your-budget-backpacking-trip</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-04-01T15:47:47.827+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;Living up to my so called nickname &amp;lsquo;Scrooge&amp;rsquo; which Leanne often likes to call me I thought I would share with you how we saved enough money to make our budget backpacking adventure a reality. Now there is no magic formula to saving money, there is however one simple rule you must obey. &lt;strong&gt;Spend less to save more&lt;/strong&gt;. The longer we saved the better we became at spending less, in the end we managed to have almost the same lifestyle whilst saving four times as much as when we started! I hope you find the following tips useful, they certainly worked for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Create a Budget&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a monthly budget, this is the most important thing will &lt;strong&gt;EVER&lt;/strong&gt; do, write all of your income and outgoings down. Create a spreadsheet so you know exactly how much you&amp;rsquo;re spending each month and where it is going. You will be surprised at how much money is wasted each month on the small things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using your budget slowly remove things and attempt to reduce your expenditure. You can and will with a little effort make massive saving on your bills. Companies will always try and overcharge you if you don&amp;rsquo;t pay attention to your expenditure by regularly putting up prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reduce Expenditure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have your income\outcome mapped out its time to make those savings, we seriously reduced our expenditure by following these simple rules.&lt;br /&gt;Ring up your suppliers and ask for a discount, when threatened with leaving they nearly always give you a reduced charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;Always pay by monthly direct debit, this way you know exactly where you money is each month and what you have left.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;Pay off any debts first, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to pay any additional interest charges.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;Electricity and Gas - always shop around, you usually get a good deal when you join but after the first year your bill will increase. When this happens it&amp;rsquo;s time to switch again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;Getting a water meter can save you money, this cut our water bill in half. However you will need to make sure this is right for you. Getting a water meter if you have a family of 6 is bad economy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;Cancel Sky, Cable or any other TV subscription services, (well maybe not Netflix, it&amp;rsquo;s so cheap you might just want to keep it). This includes any other subscriptions you might have, music services, newspapers, magazines, national trust etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;Review you internet and phone expenditure. A few phone calls can reduce these.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;Mobile phones, don&amp;rsquo;t be tricked into spending loads of money, it&amp;rsquo;s just a phone they all do the same thing in the end.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;Car insurance, these people are really trying to rip you off and whatever price you currently pay you can reduce it. When it comes to renewal time ring them up and say you have had a better offer elsewhere give them a price and not surprisingly there computer comes up with the same number. Always question your car insurance you can save hundreds of pounds in one phone call.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;Budget your shopping trips. Not only will this save you money it will also help you prepare for your budget backpacking trip. Go to budget super markets, ALDI is now your best friend. Cook your own meals instead of buying ready meals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;After working out your income\expenditure give yourself a set amount to spend each month for going out and socialising and don&amp;rsquo;t spend more than that. Don&amp;rsquo;t leave yourself with nothing, severely restricting your self is never good.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be tricked into buy one get one free offers, if you buy none you pay for none. That&amp;rsquo;s an instant saving. But of course if you&amp;rsquo;re going to buy something anyway then it&amp;rsquo;s worth taking the buy one get one free, just don&amp;rsquo;t buy something only because it&amp;rsquo;s on offer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;Leave your bank card at home, take out only the cash you need (of course you will have worked out the amount you can take from your budget) This stops you over spending especially on nights out where drinking alcohol will impair your better judgement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;Mend and make do! You don&amp;rsquo;t need that new car/ipad/designer jeans. Become more creative with what you do have.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;Clothes, you don&amp;rsquo;t need any more as you&amp;rsquo;re going travelling and you can&amp;rsquo;t take them with you. What you have now will suffice. If you have some old clothes that used to be black buy some black dye and put it in the washing machine when you wash your clothes, your clothes will look like new.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;If you have problems with your car fix them yourself. Look online, get a book, and ask a friend it&amp;rsquo;s worth a try if it&amp;rsquo;s going to save you money. Doing this saved me a massive amount of money and now I know how to fix a few motor vehicle problems as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;When saving think about that money in terms of air miles or nights in hotels. For example not going out and spending &amp;pound;50 on dinner = 4 nights&amp;rsquo; accommodation, 6 meals, and 4 bottles of Chang in Thailand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;Some of the best things are free, check out your local area for free things to do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;Increase Income&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have reduced you expenditure, try find a way to increase your income. This is much harder than reducing expenditure but its still worth thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;Get a second job.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;Sell your stuff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;Rent out a room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;Ask your boss for a pay rise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a whole host ways to make money described online, from online surveys to secret shoppers but be careful you will never get money from free, it&amp;rsquo;s likely these will be so time consuming it&amp;rsquo;s not worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally people are always trying to make you part with your money, don&amp;rsquo;t let them. &lt;strong&gt;Save hard and let your backpacking adventure begin.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Content>

    <Title>Finding the right bank account for travelling abroad</Title>
    <TitleURL>na/plan-your-own-trip/finding-the-right-bank-account-for-travelling-abroad</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-04-02T14:15:41.69+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/uploads/original/travel-bank-account.jpg" alt="Travel bank account"   /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you have saved all your money and your bank account is looking healthier but how do you spend this money abroad without having to paying for the privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You clearly don&amp;rsquo;t want to be carrying around large sums of cash, in the unlikely event you get robbed you&amp;rsquo;re going to be feeling pretty glum. So we keep our&amp;nbsp;cash in the bank to keep it safe and cash machines exist all over the world so its&amp;nbsp;is a pretty safe bet that you can easily access it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However as an example, in the UK Natwest and RBS debit cards will charge you 2.75% of the transaction value or &amp;pound;1 whatever is greater. This has only recently been reduce from 4%. Most other bank accounts offer similar dismal rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for every 100 hundred pound you spend you have to pay &amp;pound;.2.75 for the privilege, after all your hardwork saving this is surmountable to day light robbery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be this way, there are bank accounts which are free to use abroad except they are few and far between. At the time of writing there was only one bank in the UK which offered free withdrawal from any cash machine around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That account was the &lt;a href="http://www.nandp.co.uk/"&gt;Norwich and Peterbourough&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;gold classic, &amp;nbsp;it offers no withdrawal charges, no retail transaction charges or handling fees for overseas spending. The only catch is you have to either have at least &amp;pound;5000 in your account or deposit &amp;pound;500 a month or else you face a monthly charge of &amp;pound;5. What this means is that if you follow their rules you can take your money out for free whilst backpacking around the world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank accounts change often so always keep an eye out for the best deals, use price comparison websites like moneysupermarket.com to find the best offers. Even if you can&amp;rsquo;t find an account that offers free withdrawals make sure you pick an account with the lowest transaction fee to avoiding being stung for these unnecessary charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know where your money is going and don&amp;rsquo;t be overcharged for spending it, it&amp;rsquo;s the little savings that all add up ultimately allow you travel for longer.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Should you take a credit card travelling?</Title>
    <TitleURL>na/plan-your-own-trip/should-you-take-a-credit-card-travelling</TitleURL>
    <DateCreated>2015-04-07T10:56:34.163+01:00</DateCreated>
    <Content>&lt;h3&gt;&lt;img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/images/uploads/original/creditcardstraveller.jpg" alt="Credit Cards"   /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Should you take a credit card?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have read the article &amp;ldquo;F&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/na/plan-your-own-trip/finding-the-write-bank-account-for-travelling-abroad/"&gt;ind a bank account that doesn&amp;rsquo;t charge abroad&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; you will now know the easiest way to access your money whilst travelling is by using a bank account that does not charge for foreign transactions. This opens up the question, should you also take a credit card travelling?&amp;nbsp;Put simply yes you should, not to go spend all the money and get into debt, but as a backup strategy. If all goes wrong this little card will buy your ticket home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarise these are the main reasons for taking a credit card&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;Backup strategy in case you run out of money&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;Some companies require that you pay with a credit card.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;Make use of points schemes?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens if you lose your bank card? Do you have a backup strategy to get your money? What happens if you spend all your money? You can use your credit card to get you back on track, to feed yourself and to ultimately get home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some companies require you to pay with a credit card, this might include car rental companies who need the security that you can pay extra if something goes wrong.&lt;br /&gt;If done correctly you can make use of point&amp;rsquo;s schemes to get free travel. However at the time of writing I was unable to find a card that did not charge you exchange rate fees whilst still offering reward points so this was not an option. However whilst saving for your trip using these credit cards at home for your daily spending could get you free hotels and flights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Choosing the right credit card.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average credit card charges 3% on top of the current exchange rate and will charge heavily for withdrawing cash. So spending &amp;pound;100 will cost you &amp;pound;103 or more, not cool when you&amp;rsquo;re getting charged to use your own money. This pretty much ruled out all credit cards that offered rewards as they all charged for overseas spending. The choice between free overseas spending and reward points was an easy one, reward points mean nothing when you&amp;rsquo;re charged on each transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a travel comparison website such as &lt;a href="http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/travel/cheap-travel-money"&gt;Moneysavingexpert.com&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;will show you the best credit card deals available at the moment. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to list all the credit cards here as price comparison websites will always give you up to date information and should be the first place you check out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My credit card of choice is &lt;a href="http://www.halifax.co.uk/creditcards/clarity-card/" target="_blank"&gt;Halifax Clarity&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as it has the following benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;No cash withdrawal fee.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;No fee to use it anywhere worldwide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"&gt;No annual fee.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see if I did need to use this credit card overseas it would not cost me to do so. However you are still charged 12.9% APR so you would need to pay the credit card off the same day that it was used, this can be done via online banking even if you lose your main bank card. As backup strategy this card has everything I&amp;rsquo;m looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
    <ContentPreview>&lt;h3&gt;&lt;img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/images/uploads/original/creditcardstraveller.jpg" alt="Credit Cards"   /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Should you take a credit card?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have read the article &amp;ldquo;F&lt;a href="http://intrepidnomads.com/blog/na/plan-your-own-trip/finding-the-write-bank-account-for-travelling-abroad/"&gt;ind a bank account t...</ContentPreview>
